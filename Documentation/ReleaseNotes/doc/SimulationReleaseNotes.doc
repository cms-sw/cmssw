\page SimulationReleaseNotes Simulation Release Notes - CMSSW_1_8_x 

- General:
 - Changes in Geometry and DataFormats are NOT allowed
 - Changes in Digis allowed; simulated digis fully validated - no problems found
 - Many cleanups towards reducing memory footprint
 - Clean CLHEP vectors/matrices from simulation code 
 - Clean static data/methods definitions in progress

- Main changes and new features:
 - New external package HepPDT v3.02.03 and related interface in SimGeneral/HepPDTESSource
   are used towards solving problems such as missing lifetime/width; basic features introduced,
   further development in progress
 - Playback option introduced in MixingModule for CrossingFrame; tests in progress
 - Hector interface introduced but is not yet fully integrated with forward geometry
 - GFlash code re-organized in a single package; work on tuning of EM/HAD in progress
 - Tracker: geometry continues to be updated for passive material budget, agreement 
   of weighted pieces vs simulated volumes always better than 10%; 
   tests of playback option with MixingModule in progress for Low Luminosity pileup
 - HCAL: updated PMT geometry, updated table of gains and pedestals; changes in the HB (-2%) 
   and HE (+10%) energy scales reflects in digis
 - Muon/RPC: introduced realistic cluster size, noise map 

- Major bug fixes:
 - Fixed old bug in timing of displaced vertexes

- Known issues:
 - Non-reproducibility of the G4-level simulated hits remain an issue, due to internal
   problems in Geant4.8.3.p01
