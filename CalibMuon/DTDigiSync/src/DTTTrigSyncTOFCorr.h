/** \class DTTTrigSyncTOFCorr
 *  Concrete implementation of a DTTTrigBaseSync.
 *  This class define the offsets for RecHit building
 *  coherently to the digitization realized with the
 *  DTDigiSyncTOFCorr module.
 *  The offset is computes as:<br>
 *  offset = tTrig + wirePropCorr - tofCorr<br>
 *  where:<br>
 *      - tTrig is a fixed offset defined in tTrig parameter
 *        (default 500 ns)<br>
 *      - wirePropCorr is the correction for the signal propagation along the wire<br>
 *      - tofCorr is the correction for the TOF of the particle set according to
 *        tofCorrType parameter:<br>
 *        0: tofCorrType = TOF from IP to 3D Hit position (globPos)<br>
 *        1: tofCorrType = TOF correction for distance difference
 *                         between 3D center of the chamber and hit position<br>
 *        2: tofCorrType = TOF correction for distance difference
 *                         between 3D center of the wire and hit position
 *                         (This mode in available for backward compatibility)<br>
 *
 *  The emulatorOffset is computed as:
 *  <br>
 *  offset = int(ttrig/BXspace)*BXspace
 *  <br>
 *  where: <br>
 *     - ttrig from the fit of time box rising edge (taken from configuration, it is assumed to be in ns)
 *     - BXspace BX spacing (in ns). Taken from configuration (default 25ns).
 *   
 *  NOTE: this should approximate what is seen online by the BTI
