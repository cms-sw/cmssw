/** \class DTTTrigSyncFromDB
 *  Concrete implementation of a DTTTrigBaseSync.
 *  This class define the offset for RecHit building
 *  of data and simulation.
 *  The offset is computes as: 
 *  <br>
 *  offset = t0 + tTrig + wirePropCorr - tofCorr 
 *  <br>
 *  where: <br>
 *     - t0 from test pulses (taken from DB, it is assumed to be in ns; can be switched off)
 *     - ttrig from the fit of time boxrising edge (taken from DB, it is assumed to be in ns)
 *       (At the moment a single value is read for ttrig offset 
 *       but this may change in the future)
 *     - signal propagation along the wire (can be switched off):
 *       it is assumed the ttrig accounts on average for
 *       correction from the center of the wire to the frontend.
 *       Here we just have to correct for the distance of the hit from the wire center.
 *     - TOF correction (can be switched off for cosmics):
 *       the ttrig already accounts for average TOF correction, 
 *       depending on the granularity used for the ttrig computation we just have to correct for the
 *       TOF from the center of the chamber, SL, layer or wire to the hit position.
 *       NOTE: particles are assumed as coming from the IP.
 *
 *  The emulatorOffset is computed as:
 *  <br>
 *  offset = int(ttrig/BXspace)*BXspace + t0
 *  <br>
 *  where: <br>
 *     - t0 from test pulses (taken from DB, it is assumed to be in ns; can be switched off)
 *     - ttrig from the fit of time box rising edge (taken from DB, it is assumed to be in ns)
 *     - BXspace BX spacing (in ns). Can be configured.
 *   
 *  NOTE: this should approximate what is seen online by the BTI
