\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->
MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm implements the CMSSW interface to the Millepede II program
written by V. Blobel. Millepede II is the successor of 
<a href=http://www.desy.de/~blobel/wwwmille.html>Millpede</a>.
The algorithm is meant to be used as a plugin loaded by the Alignment/AlignmentProducer.
Currently it can deal with tracker, but not with muon alignment.

Millepede is separated into two part:

1) Mille:
Writes out measurements, global and local derivatives into a binary file. This part is
fully integrated into CMSSW.

2) Pede:
This standalone program is the main part of Millepede II. After reading one (or more)
of the binary files from Mille and possibly some text steering files, it computes the 
result and writes them out as a text file.

This CMSSW package handles also automatically the writing and reading of the text
files for communication with Pede.
Further documentation will hopefully be reachable in some time with a few clicks
from this <a href=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideCalAli>page in the SWGuide</a>.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->
Since the package is a plugin, there are no interfaces.
Unfortunately these classes have their header still in the interface directory:

- MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm
- MillePedeMonitor
- MillePedeVariables
- MillePedeVariablesIORoot


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->
The following block from data/MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm.cfi is intended to be
used via using declaration as AlignmentProducer.algoConfig:

\htmlinclude MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm.cfi

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
No unit tests so far, but an example cfg can be found the test directory:
\htmlinclude alignment.cfg

\section status Status and planned development
<!-- e.g. completed, stable, missing features -->
Under development.
