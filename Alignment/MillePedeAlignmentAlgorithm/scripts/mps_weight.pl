#!/usr/bin/env perl

# Author: Joerg Behr

# Usage:
# Options are:
# -h some help
# -N name weight
# -c remove all weights
# -l list all weights
# Whenever -c is used, all weights are removed from mps.db
# If neither the options -N nor -c are specified, then the first argument is interpreted as weight.
# Consequently, the following list will be treated as a list of Mille jobs to which the weight is assigned.
#
# Examples:
#
# % mps_weight.pl -N ztomumu 5.7
# Assign weight 5.7 to Mille jobs which are called "ztomumu" ("mps_setup.pl -N ztomumu ..." has to be used during job creation).
#
# % mps_weight.pl 6.7 3 4 102
# Assign weight 6.7 to Mille binaries with numbers 3, 4, and 102, respectively.
#
# % mps_weight.pl -c
# Remove all assigned weights.

mps_weight.pl [-c] [-h] [-N name] [weight] [jobids]
Parameters:
-h           This help
-l 	     List all weights
-c 	     Remove all weights from the data base
-N name      Assign a weight to the dataset "name". See the option "mps_setup.pl -N".
weight 	     The weight to be used
jobids       A list of job ids to which the weight is assigned. This option is only used if neither -N nor the -c option is specified.

The command mps_weight.pl can be used to associated weights to individual Mille binary files. Some examples are given below.

# Examples:
#
# % mps_weight.pl -N ztomumu 5.7
# Assign weight 5.7 to Mille jobs which are called "ztomumu" ("mps_setup.pl -N ztomumu ..." has to be used during job creation).
#
# % mps_weight.pl 6.7 3 4 102
# Assign weight 6.7 to Mille binaries with numbers 3, 4, and 102, respectively.
#
# % mps_weight.pl -c
# Remove all assigned weights.
