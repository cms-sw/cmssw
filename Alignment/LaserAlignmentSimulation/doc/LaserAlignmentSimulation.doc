\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

Simulation of the Laser Alignment System. This package contains a SimWatcher to OscarProducer which takes care of the appropriate actions during the various simulation steps.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- LaserBeamsBarrel: position particle gun in the Barrel to simulate the laser beams which connect both TECs with TIB and TOB.
- LaserBeamsTEC1: position particle guns in the TEC+ (both Ring 4 and Ring 6).
- LaserBeamsTEC2: position particle guns in the TEC+ (both Ring 4 and Ring 6).
- LaserOpticalPhysicsList: activate optical processes in GEANT4 (e.g. refraction).
- LaserPrimaryGeneratorAction: uses LaserBeamsBarrel, LaserBeamsTEC1 and LaserBeamsTEC2 to position particle guns in the detector and shoot optical photons into the detector. In this way the laser beams are simulated.
- LaserSteppingAction: check if absorption in a Silicon module has occurred and set the energy deposit.
- LaserSteppingVerbose: verbose output during stepping.
- LaserTrackingAction: user actions during tracking of particles through the detector.
- MaterialProperties: set properties of materials in the detector: refraction index, absorption length, etc.

\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- LaserAlignmentSimulation: this is the SimWatcher which supplies the simulation of the Laser Alignment System.
<pre>
include "SimG4Core/Configuration/data/SimG4Core.cff"
replace g4SimHits.Watchers = {
  { string type = "LaserAlignmentSimulation"
    untracked int32 DebugLevel = 0
    untracked int32 MaterialPropertiesDebugLevel = 1
    untracked double SiAbsorptionLengthScalingFactor = 1.0
    untracked double EnergyLossScalingFactor = 1739.130435
    untracked double PhotonEnergy = 1.15
    untracked int32 NumberOfPhotonsInParticleGun = 10
    untracked int32 NumberOfPhotonsInEachBeam = 100
  }
}
</pre>

- LaserAlignmentProducer: producer to provide an empty MCHepEvent. 
<pre>
module laserAlignmentProducer  = LaserAlignmentProducer
{
}
</pre>

- LaserOpticalPhysics: Custom Physics to activate optical processes.
<pre>
include "SimG4Core/Configuration/data/SimG4Core.cff"
replace g4SimHits.Physics.type = "SimG4Core/Physics/LaserOpticalPhysics"
</pre>

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->
- SimAnalyzer: get some statistics and plots about the simulation of the Laser Alignment System.
<pre>
module ana = SimAnalyzer 
{
  untracked int32 DebugLevel = 3
  untracked string ROOTFileName = "simulation.histos.root"
  untracked int32 ROOTFileCompression = 1
  untracked double SearchWindowPhiTIB = 0.05
  untracked double SearchWindowPhiTOB = 0.05
  untracked double SearchWindowPhiTEC = 0.05
  untracked double SearchWindowZTIB = 1.0
  untracked double SearchWindowZTOB = 1.0
}
</pre>

- LaserSimulation.cfg: configuration file to run the simulation of the Laser Alignment System.
