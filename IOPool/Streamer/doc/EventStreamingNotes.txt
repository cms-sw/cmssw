IOPool/Streamer is now making use of the test driver from FWCore/Utilities.

22-8-05 jbk:

Things that need to be done for the event streaming output/input modules:

The TBuffer needs to become a data member of the class and SetBuffer
needs to be called for each event.

The input module is hard coded to read the streamed events from a file.
It needs to be converted to work like the output module - where the
network protocol driver is a template parameter.

The "AuxEvent" and the process history and not handled at all.

Each product in an event gets a copy of all the provenance information.
In the future, we may be able to send a table in the event header that
contains all the common provenance information and then reference it in
the per-product provenance information.

The StreamCopy/JunkCopy test configurations still do not run.  This
may be an environment issue, because JunkCopy test just uses the 
POOL output modules and input modules to do its work.

23-8-05 jbk:

Converted input source to use a similar protocol object for doing the
transfer or save of the streamed events as the streaming output module.

Still have not checked for memory leaks in input or output modules.

The StreamCopy operations ran for a while until a made a bunch of 
changes.  A fresh rebuild seems to fix the problem.  The problem is
that a warning appears that indicates that the dictionary for the
StreamTestThing cannot be found.  There may be a problem with putting
the test EDProducts into the plugin library.  I should probably move them
elsewhere.

25-8-05 jbk:

The event stream test modules now can write many instances of the 
StreamTestThing of a configured size in order to be load testing.

The filtering of products based on type is not yet in place.

The filtering of products based on provenance or trigger bits is not
in place.

The streaming output module needs to be converted immediately to use the
BeginJob member function to do the product registry writing and 
manupulations.  This is because the fixed IDs for products are not finalized
until all constructors have run and are likely to be zero before that
time.

26-8-05 jbk:

Now the streaming output module uses beginJob for initialization
and writing the registry.  This means it requires a FWCore tag > pre8.

A memory leak checker has not been run on this code.  It is important
to do so because other packages are manipulating blocks of memory used
by this package.

15-9-05 jbk:

Changes the streamer declaration code in ClassFiller to use a different
algorithm.  First all products have "load capabilities" run on them.
It then goes though each product in the registry and declares 
the root streamers bottom-up.  All the types contained within each
product have the root streamers declared starting at the inner-most
leaf types.

The code in ClassFiller is sort of messy and needs to be cleaned up.

Setting environment variable PROC_DEBUG=9 will print a trace of what
the event stream input and output objects are doing to declare the 
product.  Setting this variable to 11 will cause the ROOT debug level
to be set to 10 during I/O operations.

18-10-05 jbk:

Many important changes.  Here is the sequence.
 1) The "Producer" of the template EventStreamInput is not initialized 
    first. It has a new role to provide the EventBuffer object to the
    EventStreamInput object instead of the EventStreamInput object making
    it.  The reason for this change is so the creation of this queue
    can be placed into a different package - one that may need to use
    services that depend on HLT related libraries.  In other words, the
    EventBuffer may be created in HLT specific code.

27-10-05 jbk: 

A bunch of transition related checkins.  The streaming input template is
going away.  The new code compiles and is checked in.  The streaming
input template and TestProducer code is not removed yet until the 
TestProducer is rewritten using the new streaming utility classes and
functions in Utilities.h.  The FragmentInput input source is an exxample
of using these functions - but not from a file.  The testing is
not complete with this checkin.

To build this, you must rename EventStreamInput.cc, TestProducer.cc
to names that do not end in cc.

01-11-05 jbk:

Added a few more functions for reading a product registry from 
file containing streamed events (for testing).

Removed the EventStreamInput.cc and TestProducer.cc files. Also
made it an error to include EventStreamInput.h.  All these files
contain the code for the old way of making an streaming event input
service.  The new way just gives the developer a set of functions
and classes to aid in the creation of an InputSource that is 
specific to a task.

Added the replacement for TestProducer.cc, called EventStreamFileInput.
This is an input source that reads from a file.

Added a file reader that can be placed into a thread to read events
message buffer from a file continuously and place them onto a queue.

Added a utility class for managing an array lifetime to TestFileReader.cc.
See the notes in readEvents().

The way threading is used in all the classes is consistent and should
really be pulled out into a template.

22-11-05 jbk:

added a bunch of code for declaring classes explicitly to root using the
pool utilities and the reflex information in order to debug a problem.
The problem appears to stem from a giving class definition in the
xml file of StreamerData - I've added it now.  The missing class was
vector<BranchDescription>.

5-12-05 jbk:

Lots of trouble.  Added a bunch of function to go through the reflex
dictionaries of product registry clases and attempt to "load
capabilities" and declare the ROOT dictionary.

Most of this was added as a result of trying to find a bug in 
streaming out SortedCollection.  Turned out to be a bug in ROOT -
a hard-coded buffer size of 80 characters for a class name.

This package is in need of a major cleanup:
 * it is not clear where and in what order the functions in 
   Utility and ClassFiller need to be called.
 * an index of functions and descriptions is needed.
 * the messages and handling function need a second revision to
   remove redundancy.
 * instructions are needed to explain the concepts.
 * the names of many things are poorly chosen.
 * The "EventBuffer" use needs to be converted over to use the
   "SingleServerQueue" in the fwcore utilities area
 * any shared functions between the various clients of the classfiller
   and loadextraclasses need to be clearly identified and shared 
   properly.

13-12-05 jbk:

added some debugging code.  changed some of the default parameters in the
HLTInfo class.  changed the order of some of the processing in the 
testfilereader.

Fixed a bug in Utilities.h.

10-01-06 jbk:

The message class and derived classes need to be reviewed.  There is a
problem with the size functions.  There are lots of them and it is unclear
when to use which one.  The storage of the message code and the reported
size of the message is also a problem - is the msgcode included in the
payload size or is it part of the header?  It is currently not reported
as part of the payload if only the MsgCode class is used.

01-03-07 jbk:

Let ROOT manage the lifetime of the buffers it uses for input and output.
Changed the compression buffers to data members instead of stack-related
variables.  Moved the TBuffers to member data.
Tested using NewStreamIn/Out.cfg with sizes bigger than than the default
buffer sizes. Also added comments to the code about percular things: 
assumed max overheads and such.
