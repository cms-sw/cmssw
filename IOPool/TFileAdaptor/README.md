# IOPool/TFileAdaptor Description

## Introduction
The package contains a plugin to ROOT to allow a custom `TFile` to be generated by calls to `TFile::Open`. The custom class internally uses the `Storage` object from Utilities/StorageFactory.

## TStorageFactorySystem
A ROOT plugin which allows the use of `TStorageFactoryFile` when `TFile::Open` is called.

## TStorageFactoryFile
A specialization of `TFile` which uses a `edm::storage::Storage` instance internally.
### storage accounting
The `read` measurement statistics only encompasses a single buffer read. `readActual` encompasses both a single buffer read and a vector read. Only `readAsync` measures statistics for reading asynchronously (prefetching?).

## TFileAdaptor
A cmsRun service which allows configuration of the `StorageFactory` and assigns which protocols for which ROOT should use `TStorageFactorySystem`.
