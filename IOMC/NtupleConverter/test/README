cmsRun mcntpl.cfg reads a CMKIN ntpl, which has been 
converted via h2root to a root file in order to use 
old ntpl for comparisons and debuging

WARNING: Only standard Pythia ntpls and ntpls with
a single or two particles are supported and tested.
Ntpls produced with external generators and interfaced to 
CMKIN are NOT tested.
