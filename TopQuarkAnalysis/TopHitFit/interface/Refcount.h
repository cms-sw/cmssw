// Purpose: A base class for a simple reference-counted object.
// Created: Aug 2000, sss, from the version that used to be in d0om.
//
// To make a reference counted type, derive from class d0_util::Refcount.
// When the object is created, its refcount is initially set to 0;
// the first action taken by the creator should be to call incref()
// to bump the refcount to 1.  Thereafter, the refcount may be incremented
// by incref() and decremented by decref().  If the reference count reaches
// 0, the object calls delete on itself.
//
// If the object is deleted explicitly, the reference count must be 0 or 1.
// Otherwise, an assertion violation will be reported.
