# PerfTools/MaxMemoryPreload Description

## Introduction

This package generated a library that is meant to be LD_PRELOADed along with libPrefToolsAllocMonitorPreload.so which
uses `cms::perftools::AllocMonitorRegistry` to register a monitor before an application begins. When the application
ends the monitor reports statistics about the allocations and deallocations.

## Usage

To use the package, one must issue the following LD_PRELOAD command before running the application (bash version
shown below)
```
LD_PRELOAD="libPerfToolsAllocMonitorPreload.so libPerfToolsMaxMemoryPreload.so"
```

the order is important.

## Reporting
When the application ends, the monitor will report the following to standard error:

- Total amount of bytes requested by all allocation calls during the job. Note that actual _used_ allocation can be greater than requested as the allocator may require additional memory be assigned.
- The maximum amount of _used_ allocated memory that was in use at one time.
- The amount of _used_ memory allocated during the job that has yet to be reclaimed by calling deallocation.
- Number of calls made to allocation functions.
- Number of calls made to deallocation functions.

This service is multi-thread safe. Note that when run multi-threaded the maximum reported value will vary from job to job.

If a job forks processes, the forked processes will also report the above information.
