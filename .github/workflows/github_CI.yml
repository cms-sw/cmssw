# This triggers git Continuous Integration tests when a PR to       #
# any branch is made. Or if a code-commit is made to any            #
# test branch (temporarily) specified below.                        #
#                                                                   #
# The tests themselves are delegated to a gitlab CI runner          #
# controlled by the .gitlab-ci.yml file at                          #
# https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/cmssw_CI .                        #
# N.B. .gitlab-ci.yml must be update if the CMSSW version changes.  #
#                                                                   # 
# Communication between the github & gitlab CIs is done via scripts #
