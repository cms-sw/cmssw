# This jet pT resolution plotting function creates resolution and response
# histogram files from jet response histograms.
# Run as follows at a PyROOT compatible environment:
# 'python addResponseAndResolution.py path/to/input_file.root'
#
# Output file will have the same name as the input file with the
# "_withResponseAndResolution" appendix added.
#
# The output will be written into the working directory, overwriting the
# existing file with same name if needed.
#
# At the moment the code writes only reso and respo histograms to the output file,
# but it should be extended to copy the contents of the input file to output as well.
#
# Author: juska@cern.ch
# Intro written 28.1.2019
#
# Extended for 'smart gaussian fit' -based resolution and response calculation
# 1 Mar 2019, and renamed the python file and function to reflect this.
# (the name was before very misleading anyway)
#
# For keeping the RMS-based calculations on the side cross-checking our results,
# the function calculates also RMS-based response and resolution histograms,
# and stores them to histograms with the appendix '_rms'.
#
# NOTE: the response given by this function is calculated with corrected jet
# transverse momentum, so it could also be called jec closure.
# We cannot calculate the traditional raw-jet response with the response
# histograms used here, because they are filled using corrected jets, as
# this is how resolution needs to be calculated.
