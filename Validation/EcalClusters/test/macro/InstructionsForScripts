Starting Scripts  FitEta.C or FitEt.C

//--------------------
Main points:
A.
	There are three types of SC analyzed by the code 
EnergyScaleAnalyzer.cc. The tree 'energyScale' has a brach em_scType.
Depending which one you are interested to look at you need to require that SuperCluster type 

Hybrid      SC -> "em_scType == 1"
Dynamic     SC -> "em_scType == 2"
FixedMatrix SC -> "em_scType == 3"

As a default, in scripts it is set to 1 ( Hybrid SC ).


B
In case multiple root files as a input function 
void load_noET() {}
need to be modified.



//---------------------
(1)
FitEta.C and FitEt.C is used to make the performance plots ( mean/effSigma of ETreco/ETmc ) as a function Eta and Et accordingly.

(2)
e.g. how to plot performace vs. ET:

> root -l FitEt.C > out.et
> grep Result out.et > output
> python plotMeanVsET.py    
( Which takes file 'output' as an input and produces plot_MeanVsET.C )
> root -l plot_MeanVsET.C  

or

> python plotEffSigmaVsET.py
> root -l plot_EffSigmaVsET.C

//-------------------------------------
Similarly, if you wnat to look at performance vs Eta.
