(1) cmsrel CMSSW_10_2_0 (for instance)

(2) cd CMSSW_10_2_0/src

(3) cmsenv

(4) git cms-addpkg Validation/CaloTowers

(5) scram b

(6) cd Validation/CaloTowers/test/CaloScan

NB: before step (7) one of the desired templates (template*.py_*) 
has to be renamed into simple template.py (which is used in step (7) below)

(7) ./make_configs.csh  
creates 50 job configs (each for 1k ev "slice" processing from input file) 

(8) ./submit_batch.csh  (LSF batch) or ./submit_HTCondor.csh (HTCondor batch) 

NB: it uses batch submission 
(batch.csh for LSF or batch_HTCondor.csh for HTCondor) at CERN 

with input file 
/afs/cern.ch/cms/data/CMSSW/Validation/HcalHits/data/620/mc_pi50_eta05.root
Each of 50 job uses 1K out of total 50K input.

In ~30-40 min (in the submission directory, /scan in this case)
the results of 50 batch jobs will start arriving. 
Once all 50 jobs finished and 50  *.root files appeared locally, 

(9) ./Merge.sh 10_2_0  (e.g. the extension name for resulting DQM file)

It will do following things:

cmsRun  merging_cfg.py
(to produce final DQMxxx.root file)

clean up the directory
rm -r pi50_*.py *.log LSFJOB_* pi50_*.root

Rename DQMxxx.root file to a convenient name

NB: there is naming convention  pi50scan<...>_ECALHCAL_CaloTowers.root
where <...> can be any meaningful string (to appear in the legend of histos). It generally indicates the release or upgrade status.

For example here it's 10_2_0 which needs to be given as the argument for Merge.sh

move this pi50scan<...>_ECALHCAL_CaloTowers.root to Validation/CaloTowers/test/macros


(10) to compare two sets of histos, for instance if you have in 
Validation/CaloTowers/test/macros 
pi50scan10_2_0_ECALHCAL_CaloTowers.root    and
pi50scan10_2_0_pre6_ECALHCAL_CaloTowers.root

(here "10_2_0" and "10_2_0_pre6" are mentioned <...> strings) - 

./RunPions.csh 10_2_0 10_2_0_pre6


(11) the result appear as the local directory 
10_2_0_vs_10_2_0_pre6_SinglePi 
  
which can be 
(i) viewed with web browser locally, e.g.
firefox 10_2_0_vs_10_2_0_pre6_SinglePi/index.html

(ii) uploaded to some web server and viewed from anywhere:

https://cms-cpt-software.web.cern.ch/cms-cpt-software/General/Validation/SVSuite/HCAL/calo_scan_single_pi/10_2_0_vs_10_2_0_pre6_SinglePi

NB:  hitso labels correspond to aforementioned <...> strings, here
10_2_0 and 10_2_0_pre6 (as a reference)

--------------------------------------------------
NB: changes in the template since 760pre6
to cope with a massive generator/smearing rearrangement in
https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/10858

(A) to continue using default GEN source:
    /afs/cern.ch/cms/data/CMSSW/Validation/HcalHits/data/620/mc_pi50_eta05.root
to be used template.py_since760pre6 (renaming it back to template.py)

(B) for newly generated GEN:
    /afs/cern.ch/cms/data/CMSSW/Validation/HcalHits/data/76X/mc_pi50_eta05.root
to be used template.py_since760pre6_forGEN_760pre6 (renaming it back to template.py)
