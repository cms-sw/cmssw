This package uses the geometry information of the subdetectors and the
simulated output from OscarProducer to find simulated hits of the full
CMS detector in global coordinates (i.e. a port of ExSimHitStatistics
to CMSSW). It inserts into the event a PGlobalSimHit object as defined in
SimDataFormats/GlobalValidation.

This package is run from the Validation/GlobalHits/test directory. To execute 
type cmsRun *.cfg with one of the following four .cfg files:

EvtGen+DetSim+Global.cfg runs the full chain of event generation, detector
	simulation and global translation making use of local .cfi files
	in the test/data directory (and in some cases standard files when
	available and appropriate). For instance, you can quickly change
	between different generators by uncommenting the one you want and
	commenting all others. Right now EGun and Pythia have .cfi files.
	Output appears in GlobalValProducer.root

DetSim+Global.cfg is as above, but uses the reference MC as input rather
	than regenerating it.

EvtGen+DetSim.cfg runs the event generation and detector simulation
	using the same .cfi files as above. The ouput goes to 
	evtgen_detsim.root which can then be processed by GlobalValProducer.cfg
 	to produce the same GlobalValProducer.root as the full chain, but 
	allowing for faster turn-around while debugging the code
EvtGen.cfg just creates a reference MC sample
Global.cfg uses evtgen_detsim.root (or any file which contains
	the output of SimG4Core) to add the PGlobalSimHit object


There are two macros to process the data.

MakeHistograms.C(src,out) is a macro that processes 
	src input file (default GlobalHits.root) creating an output 
	(default GlobalHitsHistograms) ps file with formatted histograms 
	as well as a root file holding the same histograms. This macro makes 
	use of the PGlobalSimHit accessor methods, so a .rootrc and 
	rootlogon.C file is provided to load the FWLite package to 
	provide this functionality.
MakeValidation.C(src,ref,out) is a macro that processes src input file
	(default GlobalHitsHistograms.root) comparing it against the reference 
	file (default GlobalHitsHistograms-reference.root) from a previous 
	release using the Chi2Test method and produces a 
	out (default GlobalHitsHistogramsCompare) ps file 
        with the superimposed plots (dashed blue for reference, solid red for 
        new) and the returned value of the Chi2Test.

valid_global.csh is a script to run all of the necesary packages in order to
	perform a validation of a new release
