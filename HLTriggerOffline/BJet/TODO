Validation and comparison plots:

 + L1 bits ?
 + L1 jets ?
 + L1 muons ?

 + jets, at each stage (L1, L2, L2.5, L3) (calibrated energy ?)
    [v] flavour distribution (u,d,s,c,b,g) (uds ?) (udsg ?)
    [v] energy, ET, eta, phi spectra (overall, by flavour)
 + efficiency of each filter 
    [v] flavour distribution (u,d,s,c,b,g) (uds ?) (udsg ?)
    [v] energy, ET, eta, phi spectra (overall, by flavour)
 + compute efficiens 
    [v] per jets
    [v] per events
    [ ] make efficiency histograms (useless but nice for presentations)

 + complete migration to new HLT data model
