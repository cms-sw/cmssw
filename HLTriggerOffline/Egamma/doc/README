Instructions for running code:

1. Compile the code as usual using scramv1 b.

2. Find a suitable sample to run on.  The sample should have RAW since the HLT now works from RAW.  
   Insert this in PoolSource.fileNames in test/HLTRecoWithoutFilters.cfg.

3. Change the output file name to something suitable for the input file.  The output of this stage 
   will be a root file containing all the HLT isolation variables and some other quantities of 
   interest for e/gamma.  Then do

		> cmsRun HLTRecoWithoutFilters.cfg

For Validation:
4. Edit macros/Get*Eff.C, where * is the name of one of the Egamma HLT paths: SingleElectron, 
   RelaxedSingleElectron, etc.  Change the TFile argument to the file created in 3.  Change the cuts 
   at the beginning of the file to the cuts you would like to test.  These are currently the cuts in 
   the actual HLT code as of 1_6_0.

5. Do the following:

                > cd <path-to-HLTriggerOffline/Egamma>/macros
		> root.exe
		[] .L CopyTreeMulti.C; // Only if running a Double trigger
		[] .x Get*Eff.C

   The output will be as follows: a text output to stdout of the number of events passing each filter
   and the efficiency of each filter and 3 graphs of efficiency vs. Et, eta, phi to 
   macros/images/EffV(Et/eta/phi)(SE/RSE/etc.).gif.

Bugs:
- Root scripts produce a long series of errors that do no affect the output.  I see no way to get rid
  of these in the current version of root (unfortunately).
- When eff = 1, the errors are calculated using some Bayesian algorithm in this version root.  This is
  changed to the more usual "error = 0 for eff = 1" way of working in newer versions of root.

For Optimization:
6. Repeat 2-3 for a background sample, giving the output a different name.

7. Edit macros/GetOptimization.C.  Change the signal and background file names to reflect those from 3.
   and 6.  Then do:

		> root.exe // in macros directory
		[] .L GetEntriesMulti.C
		[] .x GetOptimization.C

  The output will be a graph of Efficiency vs. Background for each trigger path filter eventually;
  currently only for the Et filter in electrons.

Bugs:
- Completely untested in 1_6_0 due to lack of background samples.
- Only does one filter for now, but can easily be scaled up after testing.
