# then, mv LED_run378456.root ../macros/rmt/LED_378456.root
#
#   go to dir ../macros/rmt and use macro zstickingDepthes.cc :
# edit file zstickingDepthes.cc (change number of run you need, and type the correct cuts you've used in .py file)
# ./compile.csh zstickingDepthes.cc
# ./zstickingDepthes.cc.exe
#
# to see the plots:
# evince zstickingDepthes.ps
#
# or use command ps2pdf zstickingDepthes.ps
# then use evince zstickingDepthes.pdf
