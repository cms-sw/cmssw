1. To start batch
One has to put the run from which one starts:
/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_HCALCALIB/HCALMONITORING/RDMScript/
 LASER_LIST/LASTRUN
 LED_LIST/LUSTRUN
 MIXED_LASER_LIST/LASTRUN
 MIXED_LED_LIST/LASTRUN
 MIXED_LIST/LASTRUN
 MIXED_PEDESTAL_LIST/LASTRUN

Input root files from local runs are automatically appeared in:
/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_hcal/comm_hcal/USC

List of runs for batch will be put in the same directories with the timestamp.
 
./batch_condor_combine.csh CALIB_TYPE ERA

Two in put parameters

CALIB_TYPE can be LED, LASER, PEDESTAL or MIXED_LED, MIXED_PEDESTAL 
refering to different types of signal organized in local runs

ERA can be  era2018, era2019, era2021 
it corresponds to job pythons in
/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_HCALCALIB/HCALMONITORING/RDMScript/CMSSW_13_0_9/src/DPGAnalysis/HcalTools/python
 
Example of batch submission
./batch_condor_combine.csh MIXED_LED era2021


2. After batch jobs finished one has to perform command
./update_rdmpage_new.csh

To update web page
https://cms-hcal-dpg.web.cern.ch/cms-hcal-dpg/HcalRemoteMonitoring/RMT/

3. One can include batch submission in crontab by 
acrontab -e

All pathes have to be full path starting from root directory.


4. Log files will be in:
/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_HCALCALIB/HCALMONITORING/RDMScript/
BSUB -> condor jobs 
LOG -> job output
BATCHLOG -> condoroutput

Files with gistograms will be put in
/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_hcal/comm_hcal/www/HcalRemoteMonitoring/RMT/histos
