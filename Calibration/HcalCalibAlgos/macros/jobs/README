Steps to be taken to submit batch jobs which create the flat ROOT Trees.
1. Modify one of the python files:
     - isoTrackNewAlCaAnalysis_cfg.py for AlCaReco files from EGamma data stream
     - isoTrackAlCaCommissioning_cfg.py for AlCaReco files from Commissioning stream
2. Use crab to submit the jobs:
     - crab submit -c CrabConfig_EGamm_EraC_2024_EGamm0.py for the EGamma stream
     - crab submit -c CrabConfig_Commissioning.py for the Commissioning stream
   This will create a whole set of ROOT output files with isolated track candidates
   of momentum between 10 and 100 Gev
3. May strip off events with track candidates of momentum between 40 and 60 GeV
   ./CalibMain.exe 3 <InputFile> <HistogramFile> <Flag> <DirectoryName> <Prefix>
                   <PUcorr> <Truncate> <Nmax> <pmin> <pmax> <debug>

Create the executable CalibMain.exe using the script installCalib.csh

Name of the ROOT files to be used as input can be kept in a file (example d24CE.txt)

Some sample command lines for running calibration jobs (which creates correction files)
and monitoring jobs (which creates a set of histograms to be used for making
histograms to be used in the next step) are kept in *jobs.txt*.

Note <DirectoryName> for EGamma stream (hcalIsoTrackAnalyzer) is different from
that for Commissioning stream (hcalIsoTrkAnalyzer)

Fit the histograms and make the plots:
root [1] .L CalibFitPlots.C+g
root [2] FitHistExtended("24CEM1.root","24CFit.root","24CE1",54,3,true,true,3,false)
root [3] PlotHist("24CFit.root","24CE1","24C E#gamma Depth Dependent",1,11,0,13.6,true,false,2)
