    can be read, end of input is reached, or an exception is thrown.

    @return The number of bytes actually read.  This is less or equal
    to the size of the buffer.  Zero indicates that the end of the
    input has been reached: end of file, or remote end closing for a
    connected channel like a pipe or a socket.  Otherwise the value
    can be less than requested if limited amount of input is currently
    available for platform or implementation reasons.

    @throws In case of error, a #IOError exception is thrown.  This
    includes the situation where the input stream is in non-blocking
    mode and no input is currently available (FIXME: make this
    simpler; clarify which exception).  */

    can be read, end of data is reached, or an exception is thrown.
