/**\class FWTableCellRendererBase FWTableCellRendererBase.h Fireworks/TableWidget/interface/FWTableCellRendererBase.h

 Description: base class for classes which handle drawing and interaction with cells in the table

 Usage:
    Renderers do the actual drawing of data into the cell (via the 'draw' method) and can allow user interaction with a cell
    (via the 'buttonEvent' method).  When drawing a cell in the table, FWTableWidget ask its held FWTableManagerBase for a 
    FWTableCellRendererBase for that particular cell and then calls the 'draw' method. Similarly, when a mouse button is pressed
    while the cursor is in a particular cell, the FWTableWidget asks its held FWTableManagerBase for a FWTableCellRendererBase for that
    particular cell and then calls the 'buttonEvent' method.  For efficiency reasons, we encourage the reuse of the same 
    FWTableCellRendererBase instance for multiple cells.  The FWTableWidget is written so that it always requests a renderer from the
    FWTableManagerBase thereby allowing this reuse to work even when the renderer holds state information particular for only one cell
     (e.g. color).
     
     Classes which inherit from FWTableManagerBase are responsible for creating the appropriate FWTableCellRendererBase for the data
     held in the table's cells.  When the FWTableWidget asks the FWTableManagerBase for a renderer for a particular cell, it is the 
     FWTableManagerBase's job to reset the renderer so that it can properly draw and/or interact with that cell.  To allow reuse of
     the same object, classes which inherit from FWTableCellRendererBase normally have 'setter' methods which are used to set the
     renderer so it can represent a particular cell.
    
    One inherits from FWTableCellRendererBase in order to provide custom ways to view data in the cell or to customize how users
    interact with the cell.  Inheritance can also be used to allow a renderer to work directly with data held by a FWTableManagerBase.
