## Upgrade workflows

To list the upgrade workflows:
```
runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -n
```

To make an upgrade workflow visible to the regular matrix, add it to:
* [relval_2017.py](./python/relval_2017.py) (for Run 2 and Run 3)
* [relval_Run4.py](./python/relval_Run4.py) (for Phase 2)

All workflows in the regular matrix can be run in IB tests,
so this should only be done for fully functional workflows.

To add a workflow to the PR tests, modify the `'limited'` list in
[runTheMatrix.py](./scripts/runTheMatrix.py).
(This should be done sparingly to limit the computational burden of PR tests.)

### Special workflow offsets

Special workflows are defined in [upgradeWorkflowComponents.py](./python/upgradeWorkflowComponents.py).
Each workflow must have a unique offset.
The base `UpgradeWorkflow` class can be extended to implement a particular special workflow,
specifying which steps to modify and for which conditions to create the workflow.

The offsets currently in use are:
* 0.1: Tracking-only validation and DQM
* 0.2: Tracking Run-2 era, `Run2_2017_trackingRun2`
