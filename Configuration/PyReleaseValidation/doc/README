PyRelVal Synopsis:

Pyrelval is a tool meant to reproduce all the configuration files of the
Release Validation with additional features especially developed for
benchmarking and profiling tasks.
Python language is used instead of the conventional configuration language.
For the time being the available physical events are:
  - QCD      
  - B_JETS, C_JETS, UDS_JETS
  - TTBAR                   
  - B_JPSIPHI                              
  - MU+,MU-,E+,E-,GAMMA,10MU+,10E-...                     
  - TAU              
  - HZZEEEE, HZZMUMUMUMU                                  
  - ZEE                           
  - ZPJJ: zee prime in 2 jets  

A python module (in the file relval_parameters_module) acts as a tiny
metaconfiguration file. The parameters that can be varied are nine: 
  - The name of the process.
  - The type of the process.
  - The energy in GeV.   
  - Number of events to generate.   
  - The input and output directories.
  - Input and output Root file names.
  - The step Simulation, Digitization or Reconstruction.
  - A flag to eliminate the output for benchmarking purposes.
  - A flag to enable the dumping the config file in the ordinary config language.
  - A flag to enable verbosity.
  - A prefix for benchmarking purposes. It puts a command before cmsRun.
An example of relval_parameters_module.py can be found in the examples
directory. 

The possibility to select the step is of great advantage when the benchmarking is concerned.
For example one can get rid of the computational costs of simulation and focus
on the bare reconstruction procedure.

The technique to call Pyrelval might be a wrapper like cmsDriver.py. This
program is able to build the metaconfiguration file relval_parameters.py from a
few command line arguments. 
Some examples of its usage might be:
cmsDriver.py QCD
cmsDriver.py 10MU+ -e 45 -n 100 --no_output
cmsDriver.py B_JETS -s DIGI -e 40_130 -n 50 --filein MYSIMJETS 
cmsDriver.py MU+ -n 1000 --prefix valgrind
(For a further help type cmsDriver.py -h)

The only compulsory option is the event type. If no other preference is
specified for the other parameters, default values are assigned.
