The Phase2 geometries are automatically created using the script [generate2023Geometry.py](./scripts/generate2023Geometry.py).

Different versions of various subdetectors can be combined. The available versions are:

Tracker:
* T1: Phase2 tilted tracker (v2016-04-12) w/ phase 1 (extended) pixel - DEPRECATED, superseded by T3
* T2: Phase2 flat tracker (v2016-04-12) w/ phase 1 (extended) pixel- DEPRECATED, superseded by T4
* T3: Phase2 tilted tracker (v3.6.5) w/ phase 2 pixel (v4.0.2.6)
* T4: Phase2 flat tracker (v2016-04-12) w/ phase 2 pixel (v4.0.2.6)
* T5: Phase2 tilted tracker (v3.6.5) w/ phase 2 pixel (v4.0.2.5)

Calorimeters:
* C1: Run2 calorimeters
* C2: HGCal (v7) + Phase2 HCAL and EB
* C3: HGCal (v8) + Phase2 HCAL and EB

Muon system:
* M1: Phase2 muon system (TP baseline) w/ GE21, ME0, RE3/1, RE4/1
* M2: Phase2 muon system for TDR (incl. granularity in ME0)

Fast Timing system:
* I1: No Fast Timing detector
* I2: Fast Timing detector (LYSO barrel, silicon endcap)

The script also handles the common and forward elements of the geometry, which are not expected to change.

Several detector combinations have been generated:
* D7 = T3+C1+M1+I1
* D4 = T3+C2+M1+I1
* D8 = T3+C2+M1+I2
* D9 = T3+C1+M2+I1
* D10 = T4+C1+M1+I1
* D11 = T5+C2+M1+I1

Currently, D4 is considered to be the baseline for the Phase 2 Tracker TDR.
