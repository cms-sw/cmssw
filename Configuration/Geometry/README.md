# Run 3 Geometries

The Run 3 geometry is automatically created using the script [generate2021Geometry.py](./scripts/generate2021Geometry.py).

Different versions of various subdetectors can be combined. The available versions are:

Tracker:
* T3: 2021 baseline after separating tracker specific material
* T4: as T3, but with zero material
* T5: as T3, but with tracker material budget reduced by 5%
* T6: as T3, but with tracker material budget reduced by 10%
* T7: as T3, but with tracker material budget increased by 5%
* T8: as T3, but with tracker material budget increased by 10%

Calorimeters:
* C1: 2021 baseline

Muon system:
* M1: 2021 baseline
* M2: 2023 GE21 shifted in position

PPS:
* P7: 2021 baseline (after removing overlaps and using common materials whenever possible)

The script also handles the common and forward elements of the geometry:
* O4: as O6, but with zero material
* O5: as O6, but with trackermaterial removed (they are in T5, T6, T7, T8)
* O6: 2021 baseline
* F1: 2021 baseline

Several detector combinations have been generated:
* 2021 = T3+C1+M1+P7+O6+F1
* 2021ZeroMaterial = T4+C1+M1+P7+O4+F1
* 2021FlatMinus05Percent = T5+C1+M1+P7+O5+F1
* 2021FlatMinus10Percent = T6+C1+M1+P7+O5+F1
* 2021FlatPlus05Percent = T7+C1+M1+P7+O5+F1
* 2021FlatPlus10Percent = T8+C1+M1+P7+O5+F1
* 2023 = T3+C1+M2+P7+O6+F1

# Phase 2 Geometries

The Phase 2 geometries are automatically created using the script [generate2026Geometry.py](./scripts/generate2026Geometry.py).

Different versions of various subdetectors can be combined. The available versions are:

Tracker:
* T15: Phase2 tilted tracker (v6.1.6) w/ phase 2 pixel (v6.1.3) (Active geometry: same as T14. Material Budget: major update in IT, gathering info from recent Mechanical designs.)
* T21: Phase2 tilted tracker. Outer Tracker (v8.0.0): TBPS update in Layer 1 (facilitate IT insertion) + In all TEDD, update sensors Z inter-spacing. Inner Tracker: (v6.1.5) from previous T17
(TFPX: Changed sensors spacing within all double-disks + Increased distance between Disks 6 and 7 + TBPX portcards between Disks 6 and 7.)
* T24: Phase2 tilted tracker. Tracker detector description itself is identical to T21 (OT800 IT615). Change of paradigm, entire description reworked to be compatible with DD4hep library.
* T25: Phase2 tilted tracker. Outer Tracker (v8.0.0): same as T24/T21. Inner Tracker (v7.0.2): Based on (v6.1.5) (T24/T21), but with 3D sensors in TBPX L1. Compatible with DD4hep library.
* T26: Phase2 tilted tracker. Outer Tracker (v8.0.0): same as T24/T21. Inner Tracker (v7.0.3): Based on (v6.1.5) (T24/T21), but with 3D sensors in TBPX L1 and 50x50 pixel aspect ratio in TFPX and TEPX. Compatible with DD4hep library.
* T30: Phase2 tilted tracker. Exploratory geometry *only to be used in D91 for now*. Outer Tracker (v8.0.1): based on v8.0.0 with updated TB2S spacing. Inner Tracker (v6.4.0): based on v6.1.5 but TFPX with more realistic module positions.
* T31: Phase2 tilted tracker. The tracker description is identical to T24/T21. The outer radius of the tracker volume is reduced to avoid a clash with the BTL geometry. The positions of the tracker components are not affected
* T32: Phase2 tilted tracker. The tracker description is identical to T25. The outer radius of the tracker volume is reduced to avoid a clash with the BTL geometry (same as T31). The positions of the tracker components are not affected. This geometry is intended as a transition step towards a realistic configuration with 3D sensors in TBPX layer1.
