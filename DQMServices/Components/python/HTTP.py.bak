class RequestManager:
  """Manager of multiple concurrent or overlapping HTTP requests.

This is a utility class acting as a pump of several overlapping
HTTP requests against any number of HTTP or HTTPS servers. It
uses a configurable number of simultaneous connections, ten by
default. The actual connection layer is handled using curl, and
the client classes need to aware of this to a limited degree.

The client supplies optional callback methods for initialising,
responding and handling errors on connections. At the very least
the request response callback should be defined.

This class is not designed for multi-threaded use. It employs
overlapping requests, but in a single thread. Only one thread
at a time should be calling `process()`; several threads may
call `.put()` provided the caller uses a mutex so that only one
thread calls into the method at a time."""

request headers to be added to each request.

default assumes each task is a URL to access and sets the `URL`
property on the curl object to the task value.

minimum this should be defined as the default one does nothing.

default one raises a RuntimeException.

creation time; the callback will be invoked for each connection
object as it's created and queued to the idle connection list."""
