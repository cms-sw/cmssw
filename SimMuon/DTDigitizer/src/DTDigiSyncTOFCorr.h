/** \class DTDigiSyncTOFCorr
 *  Digi offset computed as:           <br>
 *  t0 = Tcommon - aTOF                <br><br>
 *  
 *  where Tcommon is a fixed offset defined in                    <br>
 *  DTDigiSyncTOFCorr:offset (in ORCA the default was = 500 ns)       <br><br>
 *
 *  and aTOF is set according to MuBarDigiSyncTOFCorr:TOFCorrection: <br> 
 *  0: no TOF correction (aTOF=0)                                         <br>
 *  1: aTOF = the TOF of an infinite-momentum particle travelling from the
 *     nominal IP to the 3D center of the chamber                         <br>
 *  2: ditto, but for a particle travelling to the 3D center of the wire. 
 *     (This mode is avaliable for comparison with older data which were  
 *     produced in this way)
 *  3: aTOF = the TOF of an infinite-momentum particle travelling from the
 *     nominal IP to the 3D center of the SL. Use this, unless you 
 *     really know what you are doing.
