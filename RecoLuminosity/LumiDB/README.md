# RecoLuminosity/LumiDB

This package used to contain various scripts for working with the Run 1 luminosity database. Because most of these scripts are obsolete (and in most cases can't even be run, since the underlying database no longer exists), they have been removed from CMSSW as of 11_0 (although of course you can still find them in older versions if necessary).

If you are looking for the tools for making public plots formerly in `plotdata/`, these are now maintained separately by the CMS lumi POG in this repository: <https://github.com/CMS-LUMI-POG/PublicPlots>.

The remaining scripts in `scripts/` are used for calculating pileup distributions from the luminosity output. Please see <https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PileupJSONFileforData> for documentation on these scripts.
