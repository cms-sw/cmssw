\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

- edm::FUShmOutputModule
   - int32 max_event_size = starting size in bytes of the serialized event buffer (suggestion = 7000000)
   - bool use_compression = use compression of streamer on output (suggestion = true)
   - int32 compression_level = zlib compression level 1-9, 1=fastest and 9=smallest size,
                               <1=no compression, >9=same as 9, (suggestion = 1)
   - untracked int32 lumiSection_interval = interval in seconds between fake lumi sections, 0=use lumi section from event (default = 0)

- FUShmDQMOutputService
   - untracked int32 initialMessageBufferSize = starting size in bytes of the serialized DQMEvent buffer (default = 1000000)
   - double lumiSectionsPerUpdate = number of lumiSections for each DQM update (i.e. output)
                                    <1.0 is same as 1.0 (suggestion = 1.0)
   - bool useCompression = use compression of streamer on output (suggestion = true)
   - int32 compressionLevel = zlib compression level 1-9, 1=fastest and 9=smallest size,
                               <1=no compression, >9=same as 9, (suggestion = 1)
   - untracked int32 lumiSectionInterval = interval in seconds between fake lumi sections, 0=use lumi section from event (default = 0)
