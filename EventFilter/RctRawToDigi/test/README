EventFilter/RctRawToDigi Test Suite

In all cases, need to check the *ErrorFlag histograms output by the job.  For test 3, 
need to compare this with output from current release version.


1. test_RawToDigi_RelVal.py
	Unpack raw data in RelVal sample, and compare output with original sim digis. 
Verifies backwards compatibility with existing MC raw.


2. test_DigiToRaw_RawToDigi_RelVal.py
	Run digi2raw-raw2digi on sim digis in RelVal sample, and compare output with 
original sim digis.  Verifies packer-unpacker consistency in new version.


3. test_RawToDigi_Emulator_Data.py
	Unpack real data, and run emulator comparison.  Verify unpacker compatibility 
with existing raw data.
