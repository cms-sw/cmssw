1. Made copy constructor and copy assignment operators of
   StorageManager private, and provided no implementation. This makes
   StorageManager instances non-copyable.

   Modified boostStateMachine.cpp to avoid printing ERROR, which
   causes the 'runtest' target to appear as if a test had failed.

   All code still builds, and all tests succeed.

2. Removed StorageManager::parseFileEntry() from StorageManager
   interface, and made it a function in an anonymous namespace in
   StorageManager.cc. This function is used nowhere else, and uses no
   data of the StorageManager class; it has no reason to be a member
   function.

3. Remove smutil_ios() function in favor of boost::lexical_cast<>,
   which had already been used elsewhere in StorageManager.cc.

4. Made StorageManager::checkDirectoryOK into a free function in an
   anonymous namespace, and simplified it's call.

5. Removed several unnecessary headers from StorageManager.h; some
   were totally extraneous, some were moved to StorageManager.cc,
   and some were replaced by forward declarations of classes.
