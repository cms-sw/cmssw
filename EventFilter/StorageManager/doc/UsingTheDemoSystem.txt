INTRODUCTION
------------

The demoSystem provides a way to run stand-alone storage manager tests
(using an AutoBU process to generate events).  

It has the following features:
   * runnable from either bash or csh
   * configurable number of filter units (1 to 8)
   * separate XDAQ processes for each of the following:  BU/RB, SM,
     FUEventProcessors, ProxyServer, XDAQ Consumer.
   * configurable small or large HLT configuration
   * aliases to start event consumers connected to either the Storage Manager
     or the Proxy Server
   * aliases to start DQM consumers connected to either the Storage Manager
     or the Proxy Server
   * ability to easily switch between hosts (when one file server is used for
     a cluster of PCs)
   * support for multiple developers to run on the same host (although the CPU
     could get bogged down, of course)


BUILDING THE PACKAGES NEEDEDED FOR THE DEMO SYSTEM
--------------------------------------------------

If you already have a CMSSW project area, then you can use the following
steps to build the packages that are needed by the demoSystem:
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src'
   * 'cvs co -r <desiredSMBranchOrTag> EventFilter/StorageManager', if not
     already done, where <desiredSMBranchOrTag> could be
     refdev01_scratch_branch or CMSSW_3_0_0_pre7 or some other choice
   * 'cvs co -r <releaseTag> EventFilter/AutoBU', if not already done
   * 'cvs co -r <releaseTag> EventFilter/ResourceBroker', if not already done
   * 'cvs co -r <releaseTag> EventFilter/Processor', if not already done
   * 'cvs co -r <releaseTag> EventFilter/SMProxyServer', if not already done
   * 'scramv1 b'


RUNNING THE DEMO SYSTEM
-----------------------

First-time steps:
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test/'
   * decide on a base port number for your demo system, and configure the
     system to use that port number (and the current host). In order for
     multiple developers to use the same host for running demo systems, they
     must use different TCPIP ports for the XDAQ processes and different files
     as the basis for the shared memory keys. The shared memory key file is
     set up by the testSetup script mentioned later. Using different TCPIP
     ports is as simple as choosing a range that no one else is using
     (e.g. 45000 - 46999) and configuring the demo system to use that
     range. Please use the following steps to configure the hostname, port
     number, and configuration file type:
      * './configureHosts.sh -h' to see the command arguments that the script
        expects 
      * './configureHosts.sh <yourBasePortNumber>' (hostname is
        defaulted to the current host)

To start the system:
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test/'
   * 'source testSetup.sh' or 'source testSetup.csh' depending on whether
     you use bash or csh
   * 'startEverything' (this starts the XDAQ executables and drives the system
     through Configure and Enable transitions)

To verify that events are flowing through the system:
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test/'
   * 'source testSetup.sh' or 'source testSetup.csh' (if not already done)
   * 'startConsumer' (an event consumer connected to the SM)
      * OR 'startProxyConsumer' (an event consumer connected to the
        proxy server)
      * OR 'startDQMConsumer' (a DQM histogram consumer connected to the SM)
      * OR 'startProxyDQMConsumer' (a DQM histogram consumer connected to the
        proxy server)
      * (note that DQM histogram consumers only receive histogram updates
        every minute or so)

To drive the system through various transitions:
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test/'
   * 'source testSetup.sh' or 'source testSetup.csh' (if not already done)
   * 'globalStop'
      * OR 'globalHalt'
      * OR 'globalConfigure'
      * OR 'globalEnable'
      * (note that the 'startEverything' command mentioned above always
        sends the Configure and Enable transition requests to the system)

To destroy all XDAQ processes and clean up the shared memory segments (this
can be run at any time):
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test/'
   * 'source testSetup.sh' or 'source testSetup.csh' (if not already done)
   * 'killEverything' (note that this command will not gracefully close data
     files if run while a run is in progress - you should use the globalStop
     command for that. However, it will always get you back to a state in
     which you can run startEverything again.)


GENERAL NOTES
-------------

To modify the system to run on a different host, simply re-run the
configureHosts.csh script as shown here:
   * log into the new host
   * 'cd <yourProjectArea>/src/EventFilter/StorageManager/test'
   * './configureHosts.csh <yourBasePortNumber>' (the hostname is
     determined automatically by the script) 
These steps are useful when you need to switch between PCs in a cluster and
you have a demo system set up on a shared file system on that cluster.

Log files from the XDAQ processes are located in application-based
subdirectories underneath <demoSystemDir>/logs. Please check the log files
if/when you are experiencing problems. Log files that are older than one day
are cleaned up whenever you run the killEverything command. (So, you should
either use the killEverything command to completely shut down a demo system or
remember to clean up stale log files yourself.) The script that actually does
the work is <demoSystemDir>/bin/removeOldLogFiles.sh.

Data files from the Storage Manager are written to subdirectories underneath
<demoSystemDir>/db. (This root directory path can be changed by modifying the
filePath parameter in the StorageManager section of the
<demoSystemDir>/cfg/sm_autobu_8fu.xml.base file and re-running the
configureHosts.csh script from the <demoSystemDir>/.. directory.) Data files
that are older than 10 minutes are cleaned up whenever you run the killEverything
command. (So, you should either use the killEverything command to completely
shut down a demo system or remember to clean up stale data files yourself.) The
script that actually does the work is
<demoSystemDir>/bin/removeOldDataFiles.sh.

To change the number of filter units, modify the value of the
SMDEV_FU_PROCESS_COUNT environmental variable (either by setting it by hand or
modifying its setting in testSetup.[c]sh). Valid values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, and 8. (Note that you need to kill and restart the system for the change to
take effect.)

To change whether a small or large HLT configuration is used, modify the value
of the SMDEV_BIG_HLT_CONFIG environmental variable (either by setting it by
hand or modifying its setting in testSetup.[c]sh). Valid values are 0 (small
config) and 1 (large config). (Note that you need to kill and restart the
system for the change to take effect.)

To change the number or characteristics of the SM output streams, edit
<demoSystemDir>/cfg/sm_streams.py (or sm_streams.cfg).

To change the simulated lumi section interval, modify the evtsPerLS parameter
in the <demoSystemDir>/cfg/fu_twoOut.py configuration file (or the
fu_twoOut.cfg version if you are using an older release with the cfg-based
configuration files).

To enable the writing of DQM histogram archive files by the SMProxyServer,
change the values of the collateDQM and archiveDQM parameters to true in the
SMProxyServer section of the <demoSystemDir>/cfg/sm_autobu_8fu.xml.base file
and re-run the configureHosts.csh script from the <demoSystemDir>/.. directory.
With the proxy server archiveIntervalDQM parameter set to 1, histogram archive
files will be created at the end of each lumi section and at the end of each
run. Larger interval values will reduce the frequency of file creation. Setting
the archiveIntervalDQM parameter to zero will tell the SMProxyServer to only
output histogram archive files at the end of a run. The histogram files will
appear in the <demoSystemDir>/smpsDQM directory.
