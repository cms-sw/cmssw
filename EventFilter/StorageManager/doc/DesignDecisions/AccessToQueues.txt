Shared pointers to queues are created in the StorageManager constructor, 
stored in a SharedResources instance, and passed around using the 
shared pointer to the SharedResources.  In this model, no particular class
owns the queues.

The queue sizes are initially hard-coded.  We should make them configurable
at some point.  Presumably these configuration parameters will live in the
SM infospace, be managed by the Configuration class, and be specified in
the sm_autobu_8fu.xml file in the demoSystem.  Inside the SM, the queue
sizes can be reset at Configuration time using the following steps:
 - call the Configuration method that updates the cfg param values
 - fetch the queue size values (probably a new struct in Configuration.h)
 - call the set_capacity method on the queues whose sizes have changed.
