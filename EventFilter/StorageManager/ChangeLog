	* tag V03-14-14
	* Modified the INIT message handling in SMFUSenderEntry to handle
	  multiple INIT messages from the same RB.  Re-enabled the RBSender
	  web page.  Added partial fixes for the storedEvents problem at 
	  end run.  Added support for gracefully handling duplicate event
	  numbers when running with multiple AutoBUs.

2008-09-04  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-12
	* Modified the file closing logic so that it periodically tests whether files
	  need to be closed independent of whether events are being received or not.

2008-09-03  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-11
	* Put in Emilio's fix for his workloop code when in failed state
	* Change the value of the real default for the file closing timeout to 45s

2008-09-02  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-10
	* Possible fix for problem seen with running more FU instances
	  by properly taking into account non-unique fuID, need proper
	  fix when moving INIT message to FragmentCollector

2008-09-01  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-09
	* Temporary solution for stored events statistics, gathered in workloop instead
	  and also removed temporarily the RB senders web page link that was causing
	  problems until we can reproduce it in a test setup

2008-08-27  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-08
	* Added variable reinitialization to the ServiceManager::stop() method.
	  With this change and a fix to clear the contents of the InitMsgCollection
	  in StorageManager::enabling(), hopefully the SM will correctly handle
	  Stop/Enable transitions (with regard to output file handling).

2008-08-22  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-07
	* Fixed bug in looping over output files.

2008-08-22  Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-14-06
	* Rolled back the algorithm for closing files - it only depends on
	  a time interval with this change - there is no dependence on lumi
	  section number.

2008-08-18  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-03
	* Flashlist fixes: Uncommented fireItemAvailable of storedEvents in
	  StorageManager.cc for Constantin/Emilio. Updated forgotten conversion
	  of connectedFUs to connectedRBs in test/sm.flash.

2008-08-17  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-02
	* Fix for handling large INIT message (multiple I2O frames).

2008-08-14  Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-14-01
	* Script changes.
	* Fix to lumi file closing and minor change to Error stream handling.

2008-08-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-14-00
	* Added the Error stream.  This included converting the StreamService and
	  OutputService classes into interfaces and creating derived classes for
	  handling regular events and FRDEvents (FED Raw Data Events) [which is a
	  more generic name for Error events].  This change depends on
	  IOPool/Streamer V05-02-00.

2008-08-13  William Tanenbaum <wmtan@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-13-00
	* Bug fix for a repacker problem. Due to the data dictionaries being loaded
	  too late, the repacker writes the raw data fully split, rather than unsplit,
	  as was specified in the dictionary.  This is not a critcal problem in that
	  the number of extra branches due to the splitting is small.  Nonetheless,
	  this fix should be picked up in 2_1_X, although it is not critical for 2_1_3.

2008-08-13  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-16
	* Backed out recent RB Sender web page changes until we've had a chance
	  to test them more.
	* Modified the use of the XDAQ Chrono class in SMPerformanceMeter to help
	  avoid negative statistics on monitor web pages.

2008-08-07  Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-12-15
	* Fixes a flaw/bug in the way the lumi-section timeout is handled. 
	  Following the suggestion by Kurt the following is enforced:
	   1. The first flaw is that the LumiSectionTimeout is enforced against
	      the time that the last event arrived for LumiSection N instead of
	      the time of the arrival of the first event in LumiSection N+1.
	   2. The second flaw is that each stream keeps track of its own
	      starting point for the timeout rather than using a common value.
	  This is implemented by a modified version of
	  StreamService::closeTimedOutFiles() which is called by
	  ServiceManager::ManageEventMessage() for each stream.

2008-07-19  William Tanenbaum <wmtan@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-14
	* Critical fix for Streamer.  The streamer has not been kept up to date with
	  changes in the format of metadata, so it was not saving all of the metadata,
	  in particular, the Parameterset registry, Module Description registry,
	  EventHistory registry, and EntryDescription registry.  With this change, the
	  first two are saved in the header, while the data from the latter two are saved
	  not as registries, but event by event.

2008-07-17  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-13
	* Fixes from KB for scalar MEs (ints, floats, strings):  correctly determine ME
	  name; switched to using first instance when collating rather than last instance.

2008-07-03  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-12
	* Updated DQMHttpSource to take advantage of RawInputSource changes
	  (to correctly set the run and lumi numbers).
	* Removed unneeded TApplication attributed from DQMServiceManager.
	* Various (minor?) script changes from Constantin.

2008-06-25  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-11
	* Fixed bugs in DQM histogram serving and archiving.
	* Added archiveIntervalDQM configuration parameter to control how often
	  we archive DQM histograms (once every N lumi sections, where
	  archiveIntervalDQM = N).
	* Slightly modified format of DQM archive filenames.

2008-06-23 Constantin Loizides <loizides@mit.edu>

	* tag V03-12-10
	* Bugfix to handle large files (>2GB).

2008-06-16  Kurt Biery <biery@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-09
	* Cleanup of the scripts subdirectories and modification of the scripts to
	  match what was run for Cruzet2 (full blown separate DB and new DB scheme 
          handling).  [from Constantin]
	* Modification of the EventServer to match what was run in
	  Cruzet2 (fair-share off, rates limited at the EventServer input, and 
	  events for consumers restricted to a single HLT output module).

	* Moved calls to scripts outside of the Storage manager and fixed web display of
	  running Workers (script jobs)

2008-05-12  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-02
	* Include a callback function to handle error events from resource broker with separate
	  I2O function code. Gave it a new ERROR_EVENT message code that requires
	  IOPool/Streamer tag hwkc20080512 (V04-34-01), this stops problems on receiving error
	  events, but the error events are not yet written out!

2008-05-11  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-01
	* Report storedEvents as actually stored events and not received events. Added reporting
	  of received events for each HLT output module, and stored events for each SM stream.

	* Fixes to allow propor behavior for file sizes greater than 2GB, and to
	  make the cfg file specify the max file size in MBytes instead of bytes.

	  HLT output modules.

2008-02-02  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-09-02 
        * New version of SMPerformanceMeterfor thread safety so SMProxyServer can
          use this for both incoming and outgoing statistics when in pull mode
        * Modified StorageManager to use this new version and test XML config to
          set SMProxyServer parameters

          lumi numbers, same convention as for event data files. Also to chmod to
          DQM output root files to make them world readable.

2007-10-18  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-07-09

	* tag V03-07-04
	* fixed EventStreamHttpReader to allow proper end of run processing, 
          and add an example to check proper behaviour. Requires
          IOPool/Streamer V04-24-00 only in the 1_7_X series.

          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if
          any of these do not exist.

2007-08-18  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-07-00
        * changes to move parameters out of streamer output modules and
          allow default values. So online parameters are in the SM XDAQ XML file
          while offline parameters have defaults and can be missing from the
          config file. The parameters common to all streams appear in the XML
          file, while each specific stay in the SM config file.
        * Change to allow the Storage Manager main thread to see the status of
          the FragmentCollector thread, and print out error messages for problems.
          Can later do cleanup and change to a fail state is desired.
