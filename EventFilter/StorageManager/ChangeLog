	* tag V03-12-02
	* Include a callback function to handle error events from resource broker with separate
	  I2O function code. Gave it a new ERROR_EVENT message code that requires
	  IOPool/Streamer tag hwkc20080512 (V04-34-01), this stops problems on receiving error
	  events, but the error events are not yet written out!

2008-05-11  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-12-01
	* Report storedEvents as actually stored events and not received events. Added reporting
	  of received events for each HLT output module, and stored events for each SM stream.

2007-10-18  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-07-09
	* Fixed ConsumerPipe to avoid 2 sec/event delay in pushing events to the
          SMProxyServer, and also fix intermittent hang in pushing events when

	* tag V03-07-01
        * Check that output base path, mailbox path, and perl script files 
          actually exist during configure action, go into fail state if
          any of these do not exist.

2007-08-18  Harry Cheung <cheung@fnal.gov>

	* tag V03-07-00
        * changes to move parameters out of streamer output modules and
          allow default values. So online parameters are in the SM XDAQ XML file
          while offline parameters have defaults and can be missing from the
          config file. The parameters common to all streams appear in the XML
          file, while each specific stay in the SM config file.
        * Change to allow the Storage Manager main thread to see the status of
          the FragmentCollector thread, and print out error messages for problems.
          Can later do cleanup and change to a fail state is desired.
