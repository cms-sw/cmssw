2007-03-30  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-03
	* improvements to scripts/initialize
	* the script detects now for all four packages if they are checked
	out locally or not
	* the '-playback' command line option can (must!) now be passed an
	argumnet, which is either a root file or an ASCII file with a list
	of root files

2007-03-29  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-02
	* add perl script 'scripts/initialize'
	* executing the script will start a complete AutoBU-RB-EP-SM
	system on the local machine
	* perl scripts 'configure', 'enable', 'stop', 'halt', and
	'destroy' are created as well. Execute them to control the system
	* destroy is actually going to remove any trace of your test,
	including the logs
	* command line options are:
	  -playback
	  -drop
	  -noSM
	  -host <machine.cern.ch>
	* the playback option will assume one playback file at
	/tmp/playback.root. In a future version, the file or list of files
	can be passed to the -playback option.

2007-03-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* fix sync issue where an event could have actually been discarded
	before being added to the sentIds std::set before.

2007-03-27  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-04-00
	* pretty much rewrote the whole application
	* three different threads now for receiving requests, building
	events, and sending events
	* parameter 'dataBufSize' renamed 'msgBufferSize'
	* add class evf::BUEvent
	* events are (pre-) built in a queue
	* option 'replay': build the queue once, then keep rerunning on
	those events
	* option 'crc': do / don't calculate crc check
	* in PLAYBACK mode, I see a strange error in the
	BU_DISCARD_Callback. To be investigated
	
2007-03-26  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-03-02

2007-03-11  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-03-01

2007-03-08  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	'configured' state
	* verify that "configure - enable - halt - configure - enable"
	sequence is functional

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-09
	* bug fix

2006-11-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-08
	* fix the way the internal fed buffers are filled in PLAYBACK
	mode. It wouldn't have worked for more than 64 feds (so it
	doesn't matter much for MTCC I/II data)
	

2006-11-24  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-07
	* protect call to 'postFrame' with a try/catch block and keep
	trying to post until it succeeds. Two new debug counters,
	nbPostFrame_ and nbPostFrameFailed_ keep track of this.

2006-11-22  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-06
	* add initTimer()/startTimer()/stopTimer
	methods. start The timer upon receiving the first request, not
	when enabling.
	* lock the thread when manipulating the variables used in the
	performance measurements, like nbBytes_.
	* rename bSem_ -> lock_. Add lock()/unlock() methods.

2006-11-09  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-05
	* fix bug regarding the FRL_LAST_SEGM flag not being set
	  appropriately in rare cases, spotted by Emilio
	* To distribute all valid feds among all superfragments, allow for
	  two different numbers of feds per superfragment. See
	  initFedBuffers(nFed), which is looking at (and possibly
	  changing!) nSuperFrag_ to distribute all FED Ids into
	  superfragments.

2006-11-03  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-04
	* add monitor parameters monitored by the 'real' BU
	* in "RANDOM" mode, only generate 'valid' FED IDs
	(DataFormats/FEDRawData/FEDNumbering); equaly distribute all valid
	FED IDs over superfragments. Don't use FED IDs which are 'left'
	due to the fact that nFEDs%nSF!=0.
	

2006-10-28  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-03

	* tag V00-02-02
	* turn nbMBPerSec_ from xdata::UnsignedInteger32 into a
	  xdata::Double

2006-10-23  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-01
	* fix memory leak: in playback mode, evf::BU must assume ownership
          of the FEDRawDataCollection received from the
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider and properly clean it up, which it now does.

2006-10-23  Philipp SCHIEFERDECKER  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-02-00
	* introduce namespace evf::
	* evf::BU is now a statemachine
	  (Configure - Enable - Halt, Suspend - Resume,
	  see EventFilter/Utilities/EPStateMachine)
	* evf::BU contains a WebGUI (see EventFilter/Utilities) to take
          care of managing exported parameters and displaying them on
	  HyperDAQ webpages
	* evf::BU measures the number of events and number of MB per
	  second sent
	* evf::BU listens to the *change* of the 'mode' parameter and
          intercepts it, as the mode of the module (RANDOM/PLAYBACK) is
	  (only!) automatically determined by the absence/presence of a
	  PlaybackRawDataProvider (see EventFilter/Playback).
	* changed the internal memory managment, fedData_ and fedSize_ are
	  now simpler data structures that are allocated only once
	

2006-09-26  Philipp Schieferdecker  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-01
	* bug fix: set buResourceId in message (value is irrelevant)

2006-09-26  Philipp Schieferdecker  <philipp.schieferdecker@cern.ch>

	* tag V00-01-00
	* fedData_ is a member of BU now; it is a vector of fed buffers,
	the length of each buffer is kept in fedSize_. Now, the fed header
	and trailer (and their sizes!) are included in fedData_ and
	fedSize_ (used to be payload only).
	* BU::createSuperFrag creates the i2o message to send the
	superfragment to the requestor. The feds are taken from fedData_,
	considering fedSize_. The fed headers and trailers are filled with
	meaningful content, including the same crc check
	(EventFilter/Utilities/inteface/Crc.h) performed online.
	* for randomely generated FED data, the parameter names have
	changed to fedSizeMean_ and fedSizeWidth_. useFixedSize_ is now
	useFixedFedSize_.
	* BU::buAllocateNMsg is now going to look for the presence of a
	static pointer to a PlaybackRawDataProvider, see
	EventFilter/Playback. If it is non zero, fed data is not going
	to be generated randomely but read from this interface, which
	retrieves the fed collection of events recorded in a file.
