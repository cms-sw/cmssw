RunInfo:
  Non-single-diffractive (NSD) events only.  Should include double-diffractive (DD) events
  and non-diffractive (ND) events but NOT single-diffractive (SD) events.  In Pythia6 the
  SD processes to be turned off are 92 and 93.  In Pythia8 the SD processes are 103 and
  104 (also called SoftQCD:singleDiffractive).

Description:
  Measurements of primary charged hadron multiplicity distributions are presented
  for non-single-diffractive events in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies
  of sqrt(s) = 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV, in five pseudorapidity ranges from |eta|<0.5 to |eta|<2.4.
  The data were collected with the minimum-bias trigger of the CMS experiment during the LHC commissioning runs
  in 2009 and the 7 TeV run in 2010. The average transverse momentum as a function of the multiplicity is also presented.
  The measurement of higher-order moments of the multiplicity distribution confirms the violation of Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling
  that has been observed at lower energies.
