Description: 
   A measurement of the underlying activity in scattering processes with a hard
   scale in the several GeV region is performed in proton-proton collisions at
   Energies of 0.9 and 7 TeV, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the
   LHC. The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity |eta| < 2 and
   transverse momentum pT > 0.5 GeV/c is studied in the azimuthal region transverse
   to that of the leading set of charged particles forming a track-jet. Various 
   comparisons are made between the two different energies and also beteen two 
   sets of cuts on pT for leading track jet pT-leading > 3 GeV and pT-leading > 20 GeV.
   The activity is studied using 5 types of plots. 2 profile plots for the 
   multiplcity of charged particles and the scalar sum of pT. and 3 distributions 
   for the two previous quantities as well we pT for all the particles in the 
   transverse region.
