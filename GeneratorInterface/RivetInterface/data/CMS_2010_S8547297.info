RunInfo: 
   Non-single-diffractive (NSD) events only. Should include double-diffractive (DD) 
   events and non-diffractive (ND) events but NOT single-diffractive (SD) events. Examples,
   in Pythia6 the SD processes to be turned off are 92 and 93, and in Pythia8 the SD processes 
   are 103 and 104 (also called SoftQCD:singleDiffractive).

Description:
   Charged particle spectra are measured in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass
   energies 900 and 2360 GeV. The spectra are normalized to all non-single-diffractive
   (NSD) events using corrections for trigger and selection efficiency, acceptance, and
   branching ratios.  There are transverse-momentum (pT) spectra from 0.1 to 2 GeV in bins
   of pseudorapidity (eta) and pT spectra from 0.1 to 4 GeV for |eta|<2.4.  The eta spectra
   come from the average of three methods and cover |eta|<2.5 and are corrected to include
   all pT.
   
   The data were corrected according to the SD/DD/ND content of the CMS
   trigger, as predicted by pythia6. The uncertainties connected with
   correct or uncorrect modelling of diffraction were included in the
   systematic errors.
