RunInfo:
   Non-single-diffractive (NSD) events only.  Should include double-diffractive (DD) events
   and non-diffractive (ND) events but NOT single-diffractive (SD) events. For example, in Pythia6 the
   SD processes to be turned off are 92 and 93, and in Pythia8 the SD processes are 103 and
   104 (also called SoftQCD:singleDiffractive).

Description:
   The spectra of Kshort, Lambda, and Cascade- particles were measured versus
   transverse-momentum (pT) and rapidity(y) in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass
   energies 900 and 7000 GeV.  The production is normalized to all non-single-diffractive
   (NSD) events using corrections for trigger and selection efficiency, acceptance, and
   branching ratios.  The results cover a rapidity range of |y|<2 and a pT range from 0 to
   10 GeV (Kshort and Lambda) and 0 to 6 GeV (Cascade-).  Antiparticles are included in all
   measurements so only the sum of Lambda and Lambdabar and Cascade- and anti-Cascade- are
   given.  The rapidity distributions are shown versus |y| but normalized to a unit of y.
   Ratios of Lambda/Kshort and Cascade-/Lambda production versus pT and |y| are also given,
   with somewhat smaller systematic uncertainties than obtained from taking the ratio of
   the individual distributions.'
   
   The data were corrected according to the SD/DD/ND content of the CMS
   trigger, as predicted by pythia6. The uncertainties connected with
   correct or uncorrect modelling of diffraction were included in the
   systematic errors.
