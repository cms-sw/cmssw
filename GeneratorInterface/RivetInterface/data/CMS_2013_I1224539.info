RunInfo:
  7 TeV pp collisions. Events are required to have at least 2 jets with
  (pt_1 + pt_2) / 2.0 > 220.0 GeV with both jets satisfying |rapidity| < 2.4.

  up a generator to reproduce the data.>

Description:
Measurements of the mass spectra of the jets in dijet and W/Z+jet events from proton-proton 
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV using a data sample of integrated luminosity of 
5 fb-1. The jets are reconstructed using the both the anti-kT algorithm with R=0.7 (AK7) and the 
Cambridge-Aachen algorithm with R=0.8 (CA8) and R=1.2 (CA12) with several grooming 
techniques applied (ungroomed, filtered, pruned and trimmed). See the text of the paper for 
more details. For the dijet events the distributions are presented as a function of the mean 
Mass of the two leading jets in bins of the mean PT of the two jets.
