RunInfo:
   Non-single-diffractive (NSD) events only.  Should include double-diffractive (DD) events
   and non-diffractive (ND) events but NOT single-diffractive (SD) events. For example, in 
   Pythia6 the SD processes to be turned off are 92 and 93, and in Pythia8 the SD processes 
   are 103 and 104 (also called SoftQCD:singleDiffractive).

Description: 
   Charged particle spectra are measured in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass
   energies 7000 GeV. The spectra are normalized to all non-single-diffractive
   (NSD) events using corrections for trigger and selection efficiency, acceptance, and
   branching ratios.  There are transverse-momentum (pT) spectra from 0.1 to 2 GeV in bins
   of pseudorapidity (eta) and the pT spectrum from 0.1 to 6 GeV for |eta|<2.4.  The eta spectra
   come from the average of three methods and cover |eta|<2.5 and are corrected to include
   all pT.
  
   The data were corrected according to the SD/DD/ND content of the CMS
   trigger, as predicted by pythia6. The uncertainties connected with
   correct or uncorrect modelling of diffraction were included in the
   systematic errors.
