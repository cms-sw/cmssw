Description: 
   Measurement of dijet angular distributions in proton-proton collisions at a 
   center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data sample, collected with single jet 
   triggers, has a total integrated luminosity of 36 pb-1, with jets being 
   reconstructed using the anti-KT clustering algorithm using R=0.5. The data 
   are presented for the variable CHI defined as EXP(|Y1-Y2|) where Y1 and Y2 
   are the rapidities of the two leading (highest PT) jets.'
