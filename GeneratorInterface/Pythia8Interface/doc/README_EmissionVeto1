EV1_nFinal        (D=-1)      Number of outgoing particles of POWHEG Born level process
                              (i.e. not counting additional POWHEG radiation)
                              If negative, the program tried to find it out automatically.
                              Note that the automatic finding  will not work for QCD processes
                              without top quarks

EV1_vetoOn        (D=true)    This is needed if one needs to veto only on MPI (see below)

EV1_maxVetoCount  (D=10)      After 'maxVetoCount' accepted emissions in a row, no more emissions
                              are checked.

EV1_pThardMode    (D=1)       Selection of pThard (note, for events where there is no
                              radiation, pThard is always set to be Q_fac):
                              0 - pThard = Q_fac
                              1 - the pT of the POWHEG emission is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen
                              2 - the pT of all final-state partons is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen

EV1_pTempMode     (D=0)       Selection of pTemp:
                              0 - pTemp is pT of the emitted parton w.r.t. radiating parton
                              1 - pT of the emission is checked against all incoming and outgoing
                                  partons. pTemp is set to the minimum of these values
                              2 - the pT of all final-state partons is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen

EV1_emittedMode   (D=0)       Selection of emitted parton for FSR
                              0 - Pythia definition of emitted
                              1 - Pythia definition of radiator
                              2 - Random selection of emitted or radiator 
                              3 - Both emitted and radiator are tried

EV1_pTdefMode     (D=1)       pT definitions
                              0 - POWHEG ISR pT definition is used for both ISR and FSR
                              1 - POWHEG ISR pT and FSR d_ij definitions
                              2 - Pythia definitions

EV1_MPIvetoOn     (D=false)   MPI vetoing
                              false - No MPI vetoing is done
                              true  - When there is no radiation, MPIs with a scale above pT_1 are 
                                      vetoed, else MPIs with a scale above (pT_1 + pT_2 + pT_3) / 2
                                      are vetoed
                              Attention! If true add 'MultipartonInteractions:pTmaxMatch = 2' to pythia
                              parameters.

EV1_QEDvetoMode   (D=0)       Treatment of non-QCD radiation. 
		  	      0 - Colorless partons are not included in pT calculated from the shower for pTemt>0 .
		  	      1 - Colorless partons are included for pTemt>0.
 			      2 - Colorless partons are included for pTemt>0. Additionally, if a colorless parton is emitted with pT > pThard in Born-level events, then the entire event is accepted. This is relevant for all values of pTemt .  

EV1_nFinalMode    (D=0)       Specification of nfinal.  
		  	      0 - nfinal needs to be specified and is cross-checked against the final state particle content in the event to estimate whether we are dealing with radiation or not.
                              1 - nfinal doesn't need to be specified (same as neg. value of nfinal) but will be estimated. Result will be cross checked as in mode 0. 
			      2 - nfinal is not specified, the Powheg emission will be estimated by looking for particles that are a light quark(5F)/gluon that comes from a light quark/gluon (not resonance, nor top) 
			      3 - same is nfinalmode = 0, except that the nFinal check now accepts nFinal - 1 in addition to nFinal and nFinal + 1 particles (this is useful for POWHEG WGamma generation, in which there are some W-only born events); should be used with ptHardMode = 0, since the emission variables in doVetoMPIStep are not set correctly when there are three possible particle Born particle counts
