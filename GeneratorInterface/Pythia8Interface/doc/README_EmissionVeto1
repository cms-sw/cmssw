EV1_nFinal        (D=-1)      Number of outgoing particles of POWHEG Born level process
                              (i.e. not counting additional POWHEG radiation)
                              If negative, the program tried to find it out automatically.
                              Note that the automatic finding  will not work for QCD processes
                              without top quarks

EV1_vetoOn        (D=true)    This is needed if one needs to veto only on MPI (see below)

EV1_maxVetoCount  (D=10)      After 'maxVetoCount' accepted emissions in a row, no more emissions
                              are checked.

EV1_pThardMode    (D=1)       Selection of pThard (note, for events where there is no
                              radiation, pThard is always set to be Q_fac):
                              0 - pThard = Q_fac
                              1 - the pT of the POWHEG emission is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen
                              2 - the pT of all final-state partons is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen

EV1_pTempMode     (D=0)       Selection of pTemp:
                              0 - pTemp is pT of the emitted parton w.r.t. radiating parton
                              1 - pT of the emission is checked against all incoming and outgoing
                                  partons. pTemp is set to the minimum of these values
                              2 - the pT of all final-state partons is tested against all other
                                  incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen

EV1_emittedMode   (D=0)       Selection of emitted parton for FSR
                              0 - Pythia definition of emitted
                              1 - Pythia definition of radiator
                              2 - Random selection of emitted or radiator 
                              3 - Both emitted and radiator are tried

EV1_pTdefMode     (D=1)       pT definitions
                              0 - POWHEG ISR pT definition is used for both ISR and FSR
                              1 - POWHEG ISR pT and FSR d_ij definitions
                              2 - Pythia definitions

EV1_MPIvetoOn     (D=false)   MPI vetoing
                              false - No MPI vetoing is done
                              true  - When there is no radiation, MPIs with a scale above pT_1 are 
                                      vetoed, else MPIs with a scale above (pT_1 + pT_2 + pT_3) / 2
                                      are vetoed
                              Attention! If true add 'MultipartonInteractions:pTmaxMatch = 2' to pythia
                              parameters.
