# README file for MC-Tester in CMSSW
#
# MC-Tester made by:
# 	Nadia Davidson, Piotr Golonka, Tomasz Pierzchala
#	Tomasz Prezedzinski, Zbigniew Was
#
# Original CMSSW implementation by: 
#	Tomasz Prezedzinski + possible former collaborations	
#       version rejected because the reading of root files conflicted between CMSSW and MCTester
#
# Current version includes modification from the cvs version which is based on the original version with Modifications/Input from Ian M. Nugent

MCTester is contained in 3 components:
1) The software interface for CMMSW: 
	GeneratorInterface/MCTESTER/src/MCTesterCMS.cc
        MCTester >=1.0.25 is an external in CMSSW 
2) The python script:
	GeneratorInterface/MCTESTER/python/MCTesterCMS_cfi.py
   MCTesterCMS_cfi.py is an example configuration for running over generator level output and
   produces a root file: mc-tester.root. It can be run with the command: cmsRun Validation/EventGenerator/test/MCTesterCMS_cfi.py 	
   To configure MCTester, the location of the SETUP.C file must be known. Currently, the file can be copied to the working dir, but
   in future the DataCardWriter will allow for the SETUP.C file to be generated from the python fragment. This configuration file
   is needed at the analysis stage after running CMMSW.
3) The software to analyze the output histograms from MCTester:
	Validation/EventGenerator/test/analyze/
   This code is executed using the  Makefile (Note: one need to check out Validation/EventGenerator to use this part of the tool). 
   To generate the pdf file:
	a) copy 1 version of mc-tester.root to Validation/EventGenerator/test/analyze/prod1 and another
	   to Validation/EventGenerator/test/analyze/prod2 (Typically 1 version is a control)
	b) cd Validation/EventGenerator/test/analyze/ and run the code with: make
	   The output will automatically be produced a pdf. 
	c) clean the directory with: make clean

Notes:
   To modify the run parameters edit: ./test/analyze/SETUP.C. For more details see the documentation in:
	Validation/EventGenerator/doc or
	https://mc-tester.web.cern.ch/MC-TESTER/
   Or generate your own SETUP.C. This file is used for both the generation and analysis stage. Please make sure you use it both as input
   for MCTesterCMS and when running step 3. In future, it is planned to use the DataCardWriter being developed for EvtGen.
