However, when the rate goes up, DAQ-DQM may not be able to keep up with the data and are designed to skip events. Occasional skips (L1A>1) will inevitably happen at low rates due to Poisson nature of cosmic ray rates. Under no circumstances, the incremental L1A can be zero. There should be no entries in the bottom row of bins of the bottom histogram. One may also want to flag runs with extremely non-uniform response DDUs.
