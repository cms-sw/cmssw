// This class represents a sequence of steps that produce histograms by summing
// up other histograms. This can be considered a domain-specific language for

// not encapsulated, the structure is exposed.

// TODO: terminology is a bit messed up, and the code is not very clean, but
// there is really not much happening here except for input validation.
