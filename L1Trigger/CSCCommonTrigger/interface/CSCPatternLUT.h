   * to allow it to better determine the tracks.
   * These were determined from Monte Carlo by running 100,000 events through
   * the code and finding the offset for each pattern type.
   * Note that the positions are unitless-- they are in "pattern widths"
   * meaning that they are in 1/2 strips for high pt patterns and distrips
   * for low pt patterns. BHT 26 June 2001
