L1RCT Mini-Tutorial and readme
Creighton Hogg

The Level 1 Regional Calo Trigger emulator is actually a fairly simple
piece of work.

The main classes are as follows

L1RCT --> Is the main controlling class that handles all the input,
	  configuring the cards and crates as neighbors, handles data
	  sharing and runs all of the processing.

L1RCTCrate --> This is the class representing a single crate
	       It's main functions are to feed the data into
	       the RCs, and properly pass data from the RCs
	       to the EICs and eventually to the JSCs

L1RCTJetSummaryCard -->  This is the end of the L1RCT and where the 
			 GCT will have to pick up.  The "jet" summary card
			 contains within it all the important output 
			 information from the eics and the rcs.
                         Namely, it includes regions sums from the rcs
			 and the hf regions, as well as the electron
			 candidates from the eics, the tau bits and muon
			 bits from each region.
			 The hf energies go direction into jsc rather
			 than into some form of receiver card first.

L1RCTElectronIsolationCard -->  This card has only one real purpose:
				To *find electrons at all cost*!!!11one
                                The highest energy electron candidate of
				each type from each region is kept
				and passed along to the jsc.
				The two types of electrons are isolated
				and nonisolated electrons.

L1RCTReceiverCard -->  This card takes in the input and fills the regions
		       with the appropriate values after sending the
		       input through a lookuptable first.
                       It calculates regions sums, tau bits, and muon bits.

L1RCTRegion       -->  This is the most fundamental data structure in the
		       emulator.  It holds the h/e||fg bits for each tower
		       as well as the seven bit et, nine bit et, activity bit
		       and muon bit.

-- The following classes act as support for the main data types

L1RCTLookupTables -->  This contains the lookuptable functions for
		       both the jsc and the rcs.

L1RCTNeighborMap  -->  This contains the information needed in order to
		       determine the location of the neighbors of a given
		       region.  This is necessary for electron finding.

L1RCTORCAMap      -->  This is an interface between the arrays where
		       data is stored in the old RCT simulation and
		       the input of the new emulator.




Data Flow:  The overall data flow is also fairly straight forward

A vector of vectors of vectors of unsigned shorts
type vector<vector<vector<unsigned short> > > represents the barrel data
This is mostly for convenience for distributing the data to the crates
and to the rcs, but in theory it wouldn't be difficult to change to a
different representation.
For similar reasons the hf energy is represented as a vector of vectors
of unsigned shorts, i.e. type vector<vector<unsigned short> >

This data is used to fill the regions of the trigger system.
