L1Ntuples
=========

Tool to build Level 1 Trigger DPG ntuples used for L1T developments, performance studies, and rate estimation.

The general description of the L1 ntuples as used in LHC Run 1 can be found ([here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/L1TriggerDPGNtupleProduction)).
The documentation about the recipe to produces L1 ntuples is kept up-to-date in this [Twiki Page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TStage2Instructions).
Instructions and tools to prepare these ntuples are also available in the [L1MenuTools repository](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuTools/tree/master/L1Ntuples).
