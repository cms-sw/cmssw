/** \class CSCMotherboard
 *
 * Correlates anode and cathode LCTs from the same chamber.
 *
 * When the Trigger MotherBoard (TMB) is instantiated it instantiates an ALCT
 * and CLCT board.  The MotherBoard takes up to two LCTs from each anode
 * and cathode LCT card and combines them into a single Correlated LCT.
 * The output is up to two Correlated LCTs.
 *
 * It can be run in either a test mode, where the arguments are a collection
 * of wire times and arrays of halfstrip times, or
 * for general use, with wire digi and comparator digi collections as
 * arguments.  In the latter mode, the wire & strip info is passed on the
 * LCTProcessors, where it is decoded and converted into a convenient form.
 * After running the anode and cathode LCTProcessors, TMB correlates the
 * anode and cathode LCTs.  At present, it simply matches the best CLCT
 * with the best ALCT; perhaps a better algorithm will be determined in
 * the future.  The MotherBoard then determines a few more numbers (such as
 * quality and pattern) from the ALCT and CLCT information, and constructs
 * two correlated LCT "digis".

    Returns vector of good correlated LCTs in the read-out time window.
    LCTs in the BX window [early_tbins,...,late_tbins] are considered
    good for physics. The central LCT BX is time bin 8.
    - tmb_l1a_window_size = 7 (Run-1, Run-2) -> [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
    - tmb_l1a_window_size = 5 (Run-3)        ->    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    - tmb_l1a_window_size = 3 (Run-4?)       ->       [7, 8, 9]

    Note, this function does not have an exact counterpart in the
    firmware. The reason is that the DAQ of LCTs is not correctly
    simulated in CMSSW - at least the simulation of the L1-accept.
    So, this function corresponds to both the trigger path and the
    DAQ path in the firmware. In general, the function will return
    LCTs that would not be used in the OMTF or EMTF emulator,
    because they are out-of-time relative for tracking purposes. For
    instance an LCT with BX5 would be read out by the DAQ, but would
    likely not be used by the EMTF.
