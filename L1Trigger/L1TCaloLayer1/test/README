This test directory contains simple test programs and python for L1TCaloLayer1

The test programs are built using "scram b" in the test directory and they 
show up in the usual tmp area.  You can put it in your path if you wish.
The best bet is to simply build and run them using "scram b runtests"

testUCTGeometry
	This is a simple geometry tester which tries out most combinations of calorimeter index and Layer-1 translations

testUCTLayer1
	This program uses pseudo random numbers as input to test the emulator functionality

testL1TCaloLayer1.py
	This python is input to cmsRun to test the emulator.  It needs an EDM file with FED raw data.
	It runs both the Layer-1 unpacker and the emulator to produce an EDM file with CaloTower collection.
