# Defines the L1 Emulator sequence for simulation use-case subsystem emulators
# run on the results of previous (in the hardware chain) subsystem emulator:
#  
#     SimL1Emulator = cms.Sequence(...)
#
# properly configured for the current Era (e.g. Run1, 2015, or 2016).  Also
# configures event setup producers appropriate to the current Era, to handle
# conditions which are not yet available in the GT.

# Notes on Inputs:

# ECAL TPG emulator and HCAL TPG run in the simulation sequence in order to be able 
# to use unsuppressed digis produced by ECAL and HCAL simulation, respectively
# in Configuration/StandardSequences/python/Digi_cff.py
# SimCalorimetry.Configuration.SimCalorimetry_cff
# which calls
# SimCalorimetry.Configuration.ecalDigiSequence_cff
# SimCalorimetry.Configuration.hcalDigiSequence_cff

#
# At the moment, there is no emulator available for upgrade HF Trigger Primitives,
# so these missing (required!) inputs are presently ignored by downstream modules.
