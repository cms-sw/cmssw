/**
 * This module is used to classify events of laser sequence acquired in 
 * a global run. 
 * Sorting: Events are grouped by bunch of consecutive events from the same 
 * FED. A file of such a bunch of events is identified by the FED or ECAL
 * sector and the luminosity block id of the first event.
 * 
 * Sorting strategy:
 * It is assumes that:
 * - one sequence FED does not overlap more than
 *   two lumi blocks. 
 * - lumi blocks are read in order
 * A FED file will be closed as soon as one event 2 lumi block ahead
 * from the first event feed in the file is read.
 *
 * File completion: while being feeding, .part is appended at the end of 
 * the each output file.Once a file is completed (see above), it is renamed
 * without the enclosing .part suffix.
