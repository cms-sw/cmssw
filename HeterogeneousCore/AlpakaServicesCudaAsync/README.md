## HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaServicesCudaAsync

This is a dummy package to emulate the expected behaviour of the build system:
  - the source files from the package's alpaka directories are symlinked here;
  - the various flags are set explicitly in the BuildFile.xml files.

Its content should eventually be built from HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaServices for
the cuda async backend.
