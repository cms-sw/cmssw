			EcalCondDB README
				   

This code provides an interface to the Ecal Databases, using OCCI.
For the moment see the header files and the examples in the test/
directory for documentation.




0.  === Use within CMSSW projects ===

# setup a scram project based on the latest release (pre8 in this example)
prompt> scramv1 project CMSSW_0_0_1_pre8


# sets your $CVSROOT
project CMSSW

# change to the project source directory
cd CMSSW_0_0_1_pre8/src

# check out the code from CVS
cvs co OnlineDB

# change to the EcalCondDB package directory
cd OnlineDB/EcalCondDB

# View the tests in the test/ directory.  Edit them to provide the
# correct connection information to your database.

# build the package
scramv1 b

# run the tests
../../../test/slc_ia32_gcc323/Test<test name>



I.  === STANDALONE INSTALLATION ===


1. ORACLE_HOME

In order to compile, make sure your $ORACLE_HOME is set
correctly.

On standard CERN systems (like lxplus) the normal $ORACLE_HOME does not
have the neccessarry OCCI header files in its directory structure.
You can use the following for your $ORACLE_HOME:

prompt> export ORACLE_HOME=/afs/cern.ch/cms/external/lcg/external/oracle/10.1.0.3-1/slc3_ia32_gcc323

NOTE: Be sure there is no trailing slash at the end of this directory
name!  If there is you may get a run-time error "ERROR: Connection
Failed: ORA-32101: cannot create OCI Environment".

If the $ORACLE_HOME is not prepared on your machine you can download
the ORACLE instant client from

http://oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/index.html

You may have to register a free account on oracle.com.


2.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Next you should set your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

prompt>  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib


3.  Connection Information

Edit the test/TestCondDB.cpp file to set the correct connection
information for the database you plan to use.


4.  Compiling

Compile the program by running 'make -f makefile.standalone' in the src directory.


5.  Running

When the compiling is finished you can run the example programs
from the test/ directory.

prompt>  ./test/TestCondDB
