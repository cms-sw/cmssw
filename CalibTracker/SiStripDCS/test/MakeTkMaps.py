#Incorporating also the next step: cloning the cfg.py files (1 per log file, i.e. 1 per IOV) and execute cmsRun

#TODO:
#Could use this same script to do other processing as input to the ValidateO2O.py for other type of plots etc...

#Script assumes that it is run in the same dir as the output of CheckAllIOVs.py
#TODO:
#In the future can put it in scripts/ and take dir to run from and write to as options.
