  // a LayerCluster that is related to that SimTrackster. Be careful not to be confused by the fact that
  // similar structs are used in other HGCAL associators where the fraction is a hit's fraction.
  // The meaning of the operator is extremely important since this struct will be used inside maps and
  // other containers and when searching for one particular occurence only the clusterId member will be
  // used in the check, skipping the fraction part.

  // In this structure, although it contains LayerClusters and per layer information through them,
  // most of the information is 3D information. For a simTrackster it stores:
  // 1. Its id: simTracksterId.
  // 2. The energy related to the SimTrackster. It is the sum of the LayerClusters energy in which a SimCluster
  //    contributed. Therefore, there will be energy from each LayerCluster that is disregarded.
  // 3. lcs_and_fractions: This is a vector of pairs. The pair is build from the LayerCluster id and the energy
  //    fraction of that LayerCluster which contributed to SimTrackster under study. So, be careful this is not the
  //    fraction of the hits. This is the fraction of the LayerCluster's energy in which the SimCluster contributed.
  //    This quantifies the statement above in 2 about the disregarded energy, by exactly storing the ratio of the
  //    reconstructed from SimCluster energy over the total LayerCluster energy.
  // 4. A map to save the tracksters id (id is the key) that have at least one LayerCluster in common with the
  //    SimTrackster under study together with the energy and score. Energy in this case is defined as the sum of all
  //    LayerClusters (shared between the SimTrackster and the trackster) energy (coming from SimCluster of the SimTrackster)
  //    times the LayerCluster's fraction in trackster.
