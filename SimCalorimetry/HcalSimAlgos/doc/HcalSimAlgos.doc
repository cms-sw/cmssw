\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

This package implements the electronics simulation for all HCAL
subsystems: HB, HE, HO, & HF.

\subsection interface Public interface
<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->


\subsection modules Modules
<!-- Describe modules implemented in this package and their parameter set -->

The parameters are mostly gotten from the calibration
database.  As of this writing, the pedestal values are:
HB, HE, HO:  0.75 +/- 0.10 fC
HF:          0.75 +/- 0.14 fC

and the gains are:
HB, HE, HO:  0.177 +/- 0  GeV/fC 
HF:          0.058 +/- 0  GeV/fC (may change very soon!)


The sampling factor, the ratio of incoming energy to sim-hit energy
is 117 in HB/HE, and 217 in HO.  In HF, the SimHit units are photoelectrons.
HF photoelectrons correspond to 2.84 GeV of energy in the longs fibers,
and 2.09 GeV in the short fibers.

The photostatistics factor is 2000 pe/deposited GeV in HB/HE, and 4000 in HF.

The amplifier gain, which goes from photoelectrons to fC, is
calculated using units: pe/fC = (pe/depositedGEV) * (depositedGeV/ inc GeV) * (GeV/fC),
= photostat * sampling fraction * calibration gain
This comes out to 0.33 fC/pe, or an amplification of 2000.

The HcalHitCorrection does time slew at the moment, where each 
SimHit is delayed according to its amplitude, according to the plots
in the physics TDR.  Low-energy hits are delayed by 10 ns,
while higher-energy hits are delayed by only 3 ns.
This effect can be turned off using the "doTimeSlew" parameter.



\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
<!-- Describe cppunit tests and example configuration files -->

The HcalDigitizerTest is meant to be a standalone
test of the digitization chain.

We'll start with an example of an incident particle of 100 GeV energy
in the HB.  The sampling factor is 117, so we expect the SimHit
to have 0.855 GeV of energy.

We next convert to photoelectrons, giving 0.855 * 2000 = 1710.
These photoelectrons are subjected to Poisson statistics.
Next they go through the shaping to give a pulse, still in the units
of photoelectrons:
DetId=1107320961, 10samples
0:0
1:0
2:0
3:0
4:814.103
5:657.711
6:185.86
7:73.7753
8:31.0982
9:13.2264

This pulse is converted to fC by multiplying by the 
factor of 0.33 found above.  Next, this analog signal
is encoded, resulting in the following digi:

(HE 17,1,1) 10 samples  4 presamples
  ADC=4, capid=1, DV
  ADC=4, capid=2, DV
  ADC=4, capid=3, DV
  ADC=4, capid=0, DV
  ADC=58, capid=1, DV
  ADC=54, capid=2, DV
  ADC=33, capid=3, DV
  ADC=21, capid=0, DV
  ADC=14, capid=1, DV
  ADC=9, capid=2, DV


No noise has been added to this digi.  Default running will add noise.

HF behaves similarly, except with a much narrower time peak.
Here are the analog signals for a 100 GeV incident particle,
in the long and short fibers, respectively:

DetId=1207987969, 6samples
0:0
1:0
2:0
3:35.2

5:0

DetId=1208004353, 6samples
0:0

2:0
3:47.8

and here are the corresponding (noiseless) digis
