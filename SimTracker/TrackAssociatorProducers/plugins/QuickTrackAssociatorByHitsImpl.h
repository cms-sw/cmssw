/** @brief TrackToTrackingParticleAssociator that associates by hits a bit quicker than the normal TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl class.
 *
 * NOTE - Doesn't implement the TrackCandidate association methods (from TrackAssociatorBase) so will always
 * return empty associations for those.
 *
 * This track associator (mostly) does the same as TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl, but faster. I've tested it a fair bit and can't find
 * any differences between the results of this and the standard TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl.
 *
 * Configuration parameters:
 *
 * AbsoluteNumberOfHits - bool - if true, Quality_SimToReco and Cut_RecoToSim are the absolute number of shared hits required for
 * association, not the percentage.
 *
 * Quality_SimToReco - double - The minimum amount of shared hits required, as a percentage of either the reconstructed hits or
 * simulated hits (see SimToRecoDenominator), for the track to be considered associated during a call to associateSimToReco. See
 * also AbsoluteNumberOfHits.
 *
 * Purity_SimToReco - double - The minimum amount of shared hits required, as a percentage of the reconstructed hits, for the
 * track to be considered associated during a call to associateSimToReco. Has no effect if AbsoluteNumberOfHits is true.
 *
 * Cut_RecoToSim - double - The minimum amount of shared hits required, as a percentage of the reconstructed hits, for the track
 * to be considered associated during a call to associateRecoToSim. See also AbsoluteNumberOfHits.
 *
 * ThreeHitTracksAreSpecial - bool - If true, tracks with 3 hits must have all their hits associated.
 *
 * SimToRecoDenominator - string - Must be either "sim" or "reco". If "sim" Quality_SimToReco is the percentage of simulated hits
 * that need to be shared. If "reco" then it's the percentage of reconstructed hits (i.e. same as Purity_SimToReco).
 *
 * associatePixel - bool - Passed on to the hit associator.
 *
 * associateStrip - bool - Passed on to the hit associator.
 *
 * requireStoredHits - bool - Whether or not to insist all TrackingParticles have at least one PSimHit. The PSimHits are not required
 * for the association, but the old TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl still had this requirement. Storing PSimHits in the TrackingParticle is now
 * optional (see TrackingTruthAccumulator which replaces TrackingTruthProducer). Having requireStoredHits set to true will mean no
 * TrackingParticles will be associated if you have chosen not to store the hits. The flag is only kept in order to retain the old
 * behaviour which can give very slightly different results.
 *
 * Note that the TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl parameters UseGrouped and UseSplitting are not used.

 * @author Mark Grimes (mark.grimes@cern.ch)
 * @date 09/Nov/2010
 * Significant changes to remove any differences to the standard TrackAssociatorByHitsImpl results 07/Jul/2011.
 * Association for TrajectorySeeds added by Giuseppe Cerati sometime between 2011 and 2013.
 * Functionality to associate using pre calculated cluster to TrackingParticle maps added by Subir Sarker sometime in 2013.
 * Overhauled to remove mutables to make it thread safe by Mark Grimes 01/May/2014.
