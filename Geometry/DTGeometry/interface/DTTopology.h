/** \class DTTopology
 *
 * Conversion between the local frame of the DT DetUnits (i.e. a layer
 * of cells in a superlayer) and the "measurement frame".
 * This is a rectangular frame where x runs between (FirstCellNumber-0.5)
 * and (LastCellNumber+0.5). Note that cell numbers follow the hardware
 * convention, so that FirstCellNumber is either 1 or 2 depending of the layer.
 *
 * Note that DTs measure a time, not a position, so unlike for strip detectors,
 * there is no guarantee that a measurement in a cell will not end up in
 * the neighbouring cell. This must be taken into account for all cases where a * LocalPoint is used as an argument, e.g. to get back the channel number.
 * This will be an issue if wire misalignment is introduced.
 *
 * The Topology interface is extended with methods relevant for
 * the DT detectors, e.g. wirePosition(int), etc.
