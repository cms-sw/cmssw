 * \class TkRadialStripTopology
 * A StripTopology in which the component strips subtend a constant
 * angular width, and, if projected, intersect at a point.
 *
 * \author Tim Cox
 *
 * WARNING! Wherever 'float strip' is used the units of 'strip' are angular
 * widths of each strip. The range is from 0.0 at the extreme edge of the
 * 'first' strip at one edge of the detector, to nstrip*angular width
 * at the other edge. <BR>
 * The centre of the first strip is at strip = 0.5 <BR>
 * The centre of the last strip is at strip = 0.5 + (nstrip-1) <BR>
 * This is for consistency with CommonDet usage of 'float strip' (but
 * where units are strip pitch rather than strip angular width.)<BR>
 *
 * WARNING! If the mid-point along local y of the plane of strips does not correspond
 * to the local coordinate origin, set the final ctor argument appropriately. <BR>
 *
 * this version is optimized for tracker and is FINAL
