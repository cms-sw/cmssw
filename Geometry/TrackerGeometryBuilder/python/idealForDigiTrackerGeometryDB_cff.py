## care: This might lead to a duplication with DT and CSC equivalents of this file:
#es_source fakeGlobalPositionSource = EmptyESSource {
#    string recordName = "GlobalPositionRcd"
#    vuint32 firstValid = {1}
#    bool iovIsRunNotTime = true
#}

# Comments by GF:
# - In anticipation of the removal of the applyAlignment flag, I'd like to keep it true.
# - Then we would need to get IOVs for the fake alignments,
#   * either using FakeAlignmentSource instead of FakeAlignmentProducer in fakeForIdealAlignmentProducer.cfi
#   * or by using the commented IOV settings above.
# - But this causes problems in co-existence with e.g. GlobalTag: 
#   Both Globaltag as well as FakeAlignmentSource provide IOV - it is not distinguished to provide IOV for 
#   a given label only (e.g. 'fakeForIdeal' compared to '').
# - I'll try to contact framework people for CMSSW_2_2_0 and above.
