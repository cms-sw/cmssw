   \class    pat::TauCorrFactors TauCorrFactors.h "DataFormats/PatCandidates/interface/TauCorrFactors.h"
   \brief    Class for the storage of tau-jet energy correction factors
   
   Class for the storage of tau-jet energy correction factors that have been calculated during pat tuple production. 
   The class is created to deal with a flexible number and order of the JES correction factors, which are 
   expected to be nested. I.e. each correction level implies that all previous correction have been applied 
   in advance. This scheme corresponds to the jet energy correction scheme propagated by the JetMET PAG.
   In dividual levels of JEC are safed as CorrectionFactor, which is a 

   std::pair<std::string, float>. 

   The std::string contains a human readable label indicating the corection level, the float
   contains the JEC factor.
   
   To move from one correction 
   level to another correction level the initial correction level of the jet need to be uncorrected before
   applying the final correction factor. The class is expected to be used from within the pat::Tau only, 
   this is taken care of automatically.
