#     Check out the 8_0_7 release and cherry pick the commit that
#     adds the original version of the file
#     DataFormats/Scouting/test/TestWriteRun2Scouting.cc
#     (6 files added by that commit). There likely will be
#     minor conflicts or issues in test/BuildFile.xml that need to

#     testRun2Scouting_v3_v2_v3_v3_v2_v2_v3_CMSSW_9_4_0.root
#     Check out the 9_4_0 release and cherry pick the commit that
#     adds the original version of the file
#     DataFormats/Scouting/test/TestWriteRun2Scouting.cc.
#     Also check out the second commit that modifies that file.
#     (6 files added by those commits). There likely will be

#     Check out the 10_2_0 release and cherry pick the commit that
#     adds the original version of the file
#     DataFormats/Scouting/test/TestWriteRun2Scouting.cc.
#     Also check out the second and third commits that modify that file.

#     be resolved.
#
# Run the create_Run2Scouting_test_file_cfg.py configuration and
# rename the file it creates.
#
# The versions of the classes are encoded in the filenames in
# alphabetical order. This order is also the order the Run 2
# Scouting files appear in classes_def.xml (in the master branch
# of CMSSW).
#
# The versions that changed from 8_0_7 to 9_4_0 were the versions of
# the ScoutingMuon and ScoutingVertex classes. The change in the
# 10_2_0 was the addition of the ScoutingTrack class.
#
# 8_0_7 was chosen because the 8_0_X release cycle was used
# for 2016 data, and the scouting data formats were not updated
# after 8_0_7.
#
# 9_4_0 was chosen because the 9_4_X release cycle was used
# for 2017 data, and the scouting data formats were not updated
# after 9_4_0.
#
# 10_2_0 was chosen because the 10_2_X release cycle was used
# for 2018 data, and the scouting data formats were not updated
# after 10_2_0.
