#     adds the original version of the file
#     DataFormats/Scouting/test/TestWriteRun3Scouting.cc
#     (6 files added by that commit). There likely will be
#     minor conflicts or issues in test/BuildFile.xml that need to
#     be resolved.

#     Check out the 13_0_3 release and cherry pick the commit that
#     adds the original version of the file
#     DataFormats/Scouting/test/TestWriteRun3Scouting.cc
#     Also check out the second commit that modifies that file.

# Run the create_Run3Scouting_test_file_cfg.py configuration and
# rename the file it creates.
#
# The versions of the classes are encoded in the filenames in
# alphabetical order. This order is also the order the Run 3
# Scouting files appear in classes_def.xml (in the master branch
# of CMSSW).
#
# The only version that changed from 12_4_0
# to 13_0_3 was the Run3ScoutingElectron class.
#
# 12_4_0 was chosen because the 12_4_X release cycle was used
# for 2022 data, and the scouting data formats were not updated
# after 12_4_0.
#
# 13_0_3 was chosen because the 13_0_X release cycle was used
# for 2023 data, and the scouting data formats and ROOT were
# not updated after 13_0_3.
