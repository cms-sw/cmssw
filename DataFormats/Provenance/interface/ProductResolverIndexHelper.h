/** \class edm::ProductResolverIndexHelper

This class assigns and gets the ProductResolverIndex
associated with a type, module label, instance, and
process.  The ProductResolverIndex is used to tell the
Principal where to store a ProductResolver and how to find
it quickly.

One can also look up the same ProductResolverIndex's using
the type or base type of an element in a container in the
product (if the product is a container). In this case the
KindOfType argument to the Principal::getByLabel function
is ELEMENT_TYPE, whereas normally it is PRODUCT_TYPE.

There are also special ProductResolverIndex's generated
where the process name is empty. These indexes refer
to a special ProductResolvers that search for a matching
product from the most recent process that has a matching
type, label and instance. There is ProductResolverIndex
generated for each type/label/instance combination which
has at least one entry in the tables in this class.
Both PRODUCT_TYPEs and ELEMENT_TYPEs get these special
ProductResolvers.

The ProductResolverIndex for a particular product
will not change during a process after the ProductRegistry
has been frozen. Nor will any of the other member data
of this class. Multiple threads can access it concurrently
without problems. The ProductResolverIndexes can be safely
cached in InputTags and possibly other places, because
they never change within a process. The ProductResolverIndex
for a particular product is not intended to be persistent
and will be different in different processes.

The ProductResolverIndex is used to order the placement of
the ProductResolvers in the Principal that are either
present in the input or produced in the current process.
Be aware that there are other ProductResolvers for products
that come after ProductResolvers placed by this class.
For example, the placement of dropped products
is not handled by this class, instead by the ProductRegistry.
The reason for this distinction is that those other
ProductResolvers can change and be added as a process runs.
The content of this class never changes after the
ProductRegistry is frozen.
