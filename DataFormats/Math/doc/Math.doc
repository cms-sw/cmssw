\section desc Description
Persistent classes for mathematical types.

\subsection interface Public interface
- math::Vector <b><N></b>: fixed size N-dimensional array. The elements are stored as <tt>Double32_t</tt>,
  i.e.: are stored as <tt>float</tt> and represented in memory as <tt>double</tt>. This class has
  to be replaced by ROOT MathCore class <tt>SVector<N,Double32_t></tt>.
- math::Error <b><N></b>: NxN symmetric matrix.  The elements are stored as <tt>Double32_t</tt>,
  i.e.: are stored as <tt>float</tt> and represented in memory as <tt>double</tt>. A functionally
  equivalent class has been requested to the ROOT team. Will be replaced by this new class as
  soon as available.

\subsection typedefs 
- math::XYZVector: spatial vector with cartesian internal representation.
- math::RhoEtaPhiVector: spatial vector with cylindrical internal representation using pseudorapidity.
- math::RThetaPhiVector: spatial vector with polar internal representation.
- math::XYZPoint: point in space with cartesian internal representation.
- math::XYZTLorentzVector: Lorentz vector with cartesian internal representation.
- math::PtEtaPhiELorentzVector: Lorentz vector with cylindrical internal representation using pseudorapidity.

\subsection modules Modules
None.

\subsection tests Unit tests and examples
None.

\section status Status and planned development
Stable. Few classes to be migrated to Root MathCore types.
