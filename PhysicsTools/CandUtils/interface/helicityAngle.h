/**  helicityAngle
 *
 * Utility function that returns the helicity angle
 * It is defined as the angle between the candidate 
 * momentum and one of the daughters momentum in the 
 * mother's center-of-mass reference frame. 
 * This angle has a two-fold ambiguity (h, pi - h ), and
 * by convention the angle smaller than pi/2 is chosen.
