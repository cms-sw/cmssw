   \brief Example class that can be used both within FWLite and within the full framework

   This is an example for keeping classes that can be used both within FWLite and within the full 
   framework. The class is derived from the BasicAnalyzer base class, which is an interface for 
   the two wrapper classes EDAnalyzerWrapper and FWLiteAnalyzerWrapper. The latter provides basic 
   configuration file reading and event looping equivalent to the FWLiteHistograms executable of 
   this package. You can see the FWLiteAnalyzerWrapper class at work in the FWLiteWithBasicAnalyzer
   executable of this package.
