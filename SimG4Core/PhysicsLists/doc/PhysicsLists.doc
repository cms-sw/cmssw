\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

The package provides custom components of Geant4 Physics List constructors and 
CMS Physics Lists. Any CMS Physics List includes local components or 
components provided by Geant4.

<!-- List the classes that are provided for use in other packages (if any) -->

- CMSEmNoDeltaRay          - obsolete EM physics
- CMSEmStandardPhysics     - Option1 with custom msc: e+e- msc below 100 MeV
                             by UrbanMscModel93, muons, pions, kaons, protons, 
                             anti_proton G4WentzelVIModel+G4eSingleScattering
- CMSEmStandardPhysics95   - Option1 with custom msc: G4UrbanMscModel for all
- CMSEmStandardPhysics95msc93 - Option1 with custom msc configuration: electron msc by 
                             UrbanMscModel93, muon msc by G4UrbanMscModel
- CMSEmStandardPhysicsLPM  - Option1 with custom msc configuration: electron msc by 
                             UrbanMscModel93, muon msc by combined 
                             G4WentzelVIModel+G4eSingleScattering
- CMSMonopolePhysics       - extra constructor of magnetic monopole physics
- DummyEMPhysics           - constructor where only electron and mu- ionisation
                             are defined
- HadronPhysicsCMS         - constructor of hadron inelastic physics by name,
                             likely obsolete
- HadronPhysicsQGSPCMS_FTFP_BERT - castom QGSP_FTFP_BERT hadron inelastic

- UrbanMscModel93          - copied from G4eant4 9.6p03 to be used with Geant4 10.X
