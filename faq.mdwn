# General questions

### Where can I learn about git, github in general?

- Generic git help can be found at <http://git-scm.com/book/>.
- github.com specific help can be found at <https://help.github.com>.
- A 15 minutes, interactive, git tutorial <http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1>
- A nice video about git <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR433b0HJY>

### How do I subscribe to github?

In order to develop CMSSW you will need a github account and to link it to your
CERN account. This is easily done by going to [CMS Topic
Collector][cms-topic-collector].

* In case you don't, simply click on the "Sign up for free" button 

  ![signup button](images/github-signup.png)

  and follow the instructions to create a new account.

  Go back to the [CMS Topic Collector][cms-topic-collector] page when done.

 * In case you already have an account you can simply use "the Sign in" dialog and
put your username and password.

Once you are done, you'll be prompted to grant CMS Topic Collector the rights to
connect to your github account, simply click on "Authorize app".

Once you are done you should also setup your personal information:

    git config --global user.name <First Name> <Last Name>
    git config --global user.email <Your-Email-Address>
    git config --global user.github <Your-Just-Created-GitHub-Account>

Finally, make sure you [register in github your ssh
key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

# Working with CMSSW on github

### How do I checkout one or more packages?

If you are in a CMSSW area (remember to do `cmsenv`) you can simply use:
  
    git cms-addpkg <package-name>

once you have developments you can checkout dependent packages by doing.

    git cms-checkdeps

[To learn more about git cms-addpkg click here](git-cms-addpkg.html).

You can also find a complete tutorial [here](tutorial.html).


### How do I develop a new feature using git?

First of all you need to fork cmssw to your own personal repository. This
repository will be used to hold all your incomplete developments. 

In your working area checkout a few packages you want to modify via `git
cms-addpkg`. When you are ready to start developing create a new topic branch
to hold your developments, e.g.:

    git checkout -b my-new-feature

Notice you'll be able to add more packages afterwards, so do not worry if you
don't have all of them right ahead.

Once you are happy with your changes, push them to your private repository on
github, e.g.:

    git push my-cmssw

You can do the above multiple times, whenever you have updated your
development.  Whenever you are happy, open a pull request to merge your topic
branch into the official repository.

This can be done by going to [CMS Topic Collector][cms-topic-collector] and by
clicking on the "Create new pull request for ...".

![Create pull request](images/create-pull-request.png) 

This will redirect you to the github equivalent of the "tagset publishing"
page in the old tag collector ("pull request creation" in git jargon):

![Publish pull request](images/publish-branch.png) 

there you can select your release queue (or "release branch") and your source branch.

### How do I check the status of my pull request(s).

Go to the [CMS Topic Collector][cms-topic-collector]. There you'll find all the
open requests and their approval status.

### How do I make sure my topic branch is updated with the latest developments?

Simply merge the release branch into your topic branch:

    git checkout new-feature
    git fetch official-cmssw
    git merge official-cmssw/CMSSW_6_2_X

or in one command:

    git pull official-cmssw CMSSW_6_2_X

assuming you are on the `new-feature` branch already. 

For more information about merging branching read
[here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

You can also have a look at the CMS git tutorial found [here](tutorial).

### What about UserCode?

Please have a look at the [UserCode FAQ](usercode-faq).

### How do I tag a single package?

Tagging a single package is not possible with git, when you tag something
you'll always tag the full repository, tags are only aliases to commits.
However tags are cheap, so we can afford to tag a single integration build.

### How can I limit the diff between two tags to one single package?

You can do it by specifying a path at the end of the git command:

    git diff TAG1..TAG2 <some-path>

### Will you migrate all the release tags we used to have for `CMSSW`?

Yes, all release (`CMSSW_X_Y_Z`) tags currently in CVS will be available in
git. This is not currently the case though.

### Will you migrate all the per package tags?

No. Per package tags will not be migrated. You can however have a look at the
[Dealing with CVS History page](cvs-interaction.html) to see how you can get
old tags which were not in any release. This will also be useful to import
packages which did not end up in any release.


### Do you have any more in-depth FAQs?

Yes, please look at the [Advanced Usage](advanced-usage) section.

### Do you have a nice tutorial on how to develop CMSSW on git?

Yes, please have a look at the [CMSSW git tutorial page](tutorial.html).

### How do I ask a question?

If you have more questions about git and CMSSW on git, please use [this
form][new-faq-form].

### How do I contribute to these pages?

The documentation you are reading uses [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)
to publish web pages. To contribute to it you need to:

- Register to github.
- Fork the cmssw project under your account ([click here to do
  it](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/fork)).
- Checkout the `gh-pages` branch:

      git clone -b gh-pages git@github.com:cms-sw/cmssw.git cmssw-pages

- Edit the documentation and push it to your branch:

      <edit-some-documentation>
      git commit <my-changed-files>
      git push git@github.com:<your-github-username>/cmssw.git gh-pages

- Create a "pull request" for you changes by going 
  [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/new/gh-pages).

This will trigger a discussion (and most likely immediate approval) of your
documentation changes.
