Usage
python cfg-viewer.py <config-file>
options:
 -o : to set the name of the output html file.
      .js, .json and .css files will be stored in a seperate folder in the same directory as where the html is specified to be saved.
 -q : quiet, prints minimal messages to stdout

default:
  html file will be named cfg-viewer.html and stored in the dir where the script is ran from. All other files will be stored under cfgViewerJS/ directory in the same directory.

Problems with browsers

In order to correctly view the html file in some browsers you need to run a simple server.
This can be done by inputting "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" on the command line in the same directory as the html file.
Then view the html file by going to http://localhost:8000/cfg-viewer.html .
Some problems persist especially with browsers other than Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.


Editing

In order to edit data on the html, a local server is needed. A server called EditingServer.py is created by the script after it has run. This is stored in the same place as the html file. Run the server "python EditingServer.py", and then go to http://localhost:8000/cfg-viewer.html.
When saving a json file will be provided with the changes.
