///

/// Find a non-event-data file, given a relative path.

/// FileInPath knows how to take a string, interpreted as a relative
/// path to a file, and to interpret using the "standard CMS
/// non-event-data file searching mechanism".
///
/// The mechanism using the environment variables:
///    CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH:       may be set by the end-user
///    CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE:      should be set by a site administrator
///    CMSSW_DATA_PATH:         should be set by a site administrator
///
///  CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH is a 'search path' limited to 1 to 3
///  components. The legal values are:
///
///
///       "." or "LOCAL", which means to search for files under
///            the top level of the "local working area", which is
///            defined as ${SCRAMRT_LOCALRT}/src
///
///       "CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE", which means search the "official place",
///             defined by the value of the CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE environment
///             variable, for files.
///
///       "CMSSW_DATA_PATH", which means search the "official place",
///             defined by the value of the CMSSW_DATA_PATH environment
///             variable, for files.
///
///       ".:CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE" or "LOCAL:CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE",
///              which means look first in the current working
///              directory, then in the "official place", for files.
///
///       ".:CMSSW_DATA_PATH" or "LOCAL:CMSSW_DATA_PATH",
///              which means look first in the current working
///              directory, then in the "official place", for files.
///
///       ".:CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE:CMSSW_DATA_PATH" or "LOCAL:CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE:CMSSW_DATA_PATH",
///              which means look first in the current working
///              directory, then in both "official places", for files.

// Notes:
//
//  1. We do not deal well with paths that contain spaces; this is because
//     of the way the ParameterSet system's 'encode' and 'decode' functions
//     are implemented for FileInPath objects. This could be fixed, if it
//     is important to handle filenames or paths with embedded spaces.
//
//  2. All environment variables are read only once, when the FileInPath object is constructed.
//     Therefore, any changes made to these variables externally during the lifetime of
//     a FileInPath object will have no effect.

// TODO: Find the correct package for this class to reside. It
// doesn't seem well-suited for ParameterSet.
