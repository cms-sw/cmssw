# General-purpose modules for testing purposes

This package contains modules that are used in framework tests, but
are generic-enough to be usable outside of the framework as well.
Their interfaces are intended to be relatively stable.

## `edmtest::StreamIDFilter`

This module can be used to reject all events in specific streams.
