# Interactive Tracer Log Viewer

## Starting the viewer

### standard web server
If the output of `edmTracerCompactLogViewer.py` and the files from `FWCore/Services/web` have been placed in a directory accessible to a web server, you may just point your browser to the correct URL to run the viewer.

### local file
By default, web browsers are not allowed to read files from the local disk. Many browsers give options to override that default. After overriding the default, make sure the output of `edmTracerCompactLogViewer.py` and the files from `FWCore/Services/web` have been placed in a directory on your local machine. Then tell  your web browser to open the `index.html` file in that directory to start the viewer.

#### Local files in Chrome
In order to open a local file using Chrome, you need to
1. Exit from Chrome
1. Start Chrome from the terminal using the `--allow-file-access-from-files` argument.

On macOS, within Terminal the command would be
```
open -a Google\ Chrome --args --allow-file-access-from-files file://<where ever the directory is>/index.html
```

#### Local file in Safari
Local file support in Safari requires access the the Developer menu options. You can turn on those options by going to `Safari/Settings...`, choose the `Advanced` tab and then toggle `Show features for web developers`. Then in the newly added `Developer` tag, toggle `Disable local file restrictions`. Once you've done that, you can use `file://<where ever the directory is>/index.html` to start the application.

## Viewer layout
The viewer is composed to two main areas, the top is the timing viewer and at the bottom shows information about a selected time block. The top time viewer is further divided into three parts. On the left is the macro scoping grouping of framework activity types into Global and Stream activities. At the bottom is the measurement of time since the start of the job. The main area shows the blocks of time spend doing various work within the Framework.

Within each macro grouping of activities (i.e Global or Stream) the work being done associated to that activity are broken into non overlapping rows. The top row is always related to the larger scale activity (e.g. the total time the framework spent processing a Begin Run or an Event). Below that row is the time individual modules spent within that larger scale activity. The association of a given time block of work to a given row within a group has no inherent meeting, the rows are just meant to avoid overlapping time blocks within the same larger scale activity.

Within the Global grouping, multiple concurrent running activities (e.g. LuminosityBlocks) are assigned to their own rows with their related module timings appearing in the rows directly below them.

## Using the viewer
Single clicking on a block within the main area will select that block and display information about the block into the Selection area at the bottom of the window. Clicking outside a block within the main area will deselect any selected item.

The time shown in the main view can be zoomed in/out using a 'scroll wheel' (either a physical wheel on a mouse or by using a two finger drag on a track pad) within the display of the time measurement which is just below the main window. One can also do a drag left/right within the time measurment window to change the window of time being shown in the main view.
The area displayed in the main view can be changed by doing a drag operation within the main view.
