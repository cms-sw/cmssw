	    How the MessageService Sets Up the Module Name  
	    ----------------------------------------------

This document describes how the module name, and any suppression information,
gets where the logger needs it, in response to some function in a module getting
to the point where it is about to be called.   
	    
The key action in the MessageService itself is a sequence link

    curr_module_ += ":";
    curr_module_ += desc.moduleLabel();
    //cache this value to improve performance based on profiling studies
    descToCalcName_[&desc]=curr_module_;
    messageDrop->moduleName = curr_module_;  
    //...
    messageDrop->debugEnabled = 
    			debugEnabledModules_.count(desc.moduleLabel());
   
These are in mini-functions in MessageService/src/MessageLogger.cc,
such as preModule.

(Sometimes the module name is modified, as in:

  MessageDrop::instance()->moduleName = curr_module_ + "{ctor}";  

and we shall want to introduce some sort of consistancy on that.)

Note that any function that tries to do this with a module must be
supplied (in its signature) with const ModuleDescription & desc.

preModule and its brethren are not names known to the framework.  They 
become relevant because in the MessageLogger ctor we have lines like
  iRegistry.watchPreModule(this,&MessageLogger::preModule);
  iRegistry.watchPostModule(this,&MessageLogger::postModule);
  iRegistry.watchPreModuleConstruction(this,&MessageLogger::preModuleConstruction);
  iRegistry.watchPostModuleConstruction(this,&MessageLogger::postModuleConstruction);
These methodes of iRegistry are found in ActivityRegistry.h in the 
ServiceRegistry package; the full set is shown in Appendix B.


Meanwhile, the code for the module creates a class derived from
EDAnalyzer (see EDAnalyzer.h in the Framework package).  

This could,for different sorts of modules, have been
  class EDAnalyzer;
  class EDFilter;
  class EDLooper;
  class EDProducer;  
and perhaps also
  class OutputModule;  
  class InputSource;

See appendix A for details of module types other than EDAnalyzer.

EDAnalyzer has the following virtual void functions:

    virtual void analyze(Event const&, EventSetup const&) = 0;
    virtual void beginJob(EventSetup const&){ beginJob(); } // deprecated
    virtual void beginJob(){}
    virtual void endJob(){}
    virtual void beginRun(Run const&, EventSetup const&){}
    virtual void endRun(Run const&, EventSetup const&){}
    virtual void beginLuminosityBlock(LuminosityBlock const&, EventSetup const&){}
    virtual void endLuminosityBlock(LuminosityBlock const&, EventSetup const&){}
    virtual void respondToOpenInputFile(FileBlock const& fb) {}
    virtual void respondToCloseInputFile(FileBlock const& fb) {}
    virtual void respondToOpenOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb) {}
    virtual void respondToCloseOutputFiles(FileBlock const& fb) {}

So, for example, in the course of each event, when the analysis path comes to
this module, the analyze() method gets called by the framework.  But this is
actually a sandwich of up to 2S+1 calls, including up to two for each service:

a) If the service registers watchPreModule function, then that function is 
   called. (In the MessageLogger, we register preModule in this way.)
b) analyze() is called.
c) If the service registers watchPostModule function, then that function is 
   called. (In the MessageLogger, we register postModule in this way.)

So for each of the "life-cycle-events", EITHER associated with a module OR
independent of modules, we should do whatever is appropriate in terms of:
1) Establishing the module name (for output in messages) 
2) Establishing Run/Event
3) Setting up the enablers, based either on module label OR on a generic 
   for this life-cycle event
4) In rare cases, special ML activity like triggering a summary

We should establish these in the "pre" callback, and probably should 
restore them in the "post" callback, although under the assumptions
that we know all the cycle and handle each pre correctly, and that
nothing "of interest" occurs in the frame work BETWEEN post this and pre
that, we could take a shortcut and do without the post callbacks.  I
should probably just make those conditional code.

A few general routines should suffice:

declareModule   (writtenName, label)
declareRunEvent (string)
declareRunEvent (EventID)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A:  Other module types

EDProducer has produce (...) instead of analyze.  EDFilter has filter(...).
OutputModule has these plus 
write(EventPrincipal const& e) pure virtual instead of analyze(), along with
writeRun(RunPrincipal const& r) = 0;
writeLuminosityBlock(LuminosityBlockPrincipal const& lb) =0
and openFile(FileBlock const& fb) {}
InputSource is somewhat different.

and EDLooper has a slightly different set:
    virtual void beginOfJob(const edm::EventSetup&); 
    virtual void beginOfJob();
    virtual void startingNewLoop(unsigned int ) = 0; 
    virtual Status duringLoop(const edm::Event&, const edm::EventSetup&) = 0; 
    virtual Status endOfLoop(const edm::EventSetup&, unsigned int iCounter) = 0; 
    virtual void endOfJob();

Appendix B:  The service activities

The following activities have no arguments by the time the module-specific code 
is reached: 
:
watchPostBeginJob  // after all modules have gotten their beginJob called  
watchPostEndJob    // after all modules have gotten their endJob called
watchJobFailure    // if event processing or end-of-job processing fails 
                   // with an uncaught exception.
watchPreSource     // before the source starts creating an Event
watchPostSource    // after the source starts creating (sic) an Event
