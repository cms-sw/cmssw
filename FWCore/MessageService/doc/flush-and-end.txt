	Actions and Circumstances Relevant to Incomplete Log Problem
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
The Problem: 
------------
(Document in progress)


In about 10% of the production jobs, some of the LogInfo messages issued at the
end involving branch information are failing to emerge.  This necessitates
re-running the job, for a net loss of up to 10% of the work done.

The problem "can't be happening" based on what the logger does, but it is.  Dave
Evans worte a stand-along program to issue huge bunches of messages to try to 
provoke a repeatable version of the bad behavior, which we could hope to debug,
but could not get it to happen.

 
What the Current Code Does:
---------------------------

(This is as of 10/1/07)

All the various flushes (stream and queue), thread joins, and end-sequence
actions are described here:

Very early in main() of cmsRun, theMessageServicePresence is instantiated.
The ctor of MessageServicePresence instantiates scribe, which is a 
boost::thread, instructing it to execute runMessageLoggerScribe.

Just after that, the jobReport is created on the heap and an auto_ptr to 
JobReport is given to ServiceRegistry, retaining jobReportToken.

Next, the services are pushed onto defaultServices, with MessageLogger first.
Then the forcedServises are created; JobReport is the first of those.

Then black magic happens leading to the CFG command to the logger.  It
happens in the statement 
std::auto_ptr<edm::EventProcessor> 
         procP(new 
               edm::EventProcessor(processDesc, jobReportToken, 
                              edm::serviceregistry::kTokenOverrides));
which instantiates a new edm::EventProcessor:			      
The ctor of EventProcessor calls init().
EventPrecessor::init() calls ServiceRegistry::createSet to create the services.
ServiceRegistry::createSet instantiates a new ServicesManager, passing in
(among other things) a vector of ParameterSet.
ServicesManager has filled a list of "makers", done some complicated
bookkeeping, and called CreateServices().
In CreateServices, itmaker invokes add on its second part.  The loop this is in
is controlled by requestedCreationOrder, which has typeinfo for 
edm::service::MessageLogger first (InitRootHandlers is second).
ServicesManager::MakerHolder::add calls maker_-> make
  ServiceMaker<T> with T = edm::service::MessageLogger calls pService
  passsing in maker.make(iPS, iAR), which directly calls AllArgsMaker<T>::make
  AllArgsMaker<T>::make(const edm::ParameterSet& iPS,edm::ActivityRegistry& iAR)
  with T = edm::service::MessageLogger creates a new MessageLogger 
    ctor of MessageLogger in main thread issues the following commands on the
    MessageLoggerQ:  MLqJOB, MLqMOD, MLqCFG

Now the job is going in earnest.  When the dtor of any of the various
Log objects happens, a MLqLOG command is issued.  The processing goes
through the log() method, which is encased in a try/catch.  The first of 
such messages will print to cerr, including the words "will no longer be 
processing." ( After the first, it will be in purge mode, and others will not
emerge.)












JobReport service terminates before MessageServicePresence goes away - evidence
is the fact that the <END> message from the framework job report does come out.




would freeze if queue is full
