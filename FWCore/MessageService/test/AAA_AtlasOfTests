Atlas of MessageLogger tests

u1	Gives different thresholds to multiple destinations, and assigns
	limit=0 to annoying message categories preEventProcessing and FwkJob.
	Incidnetally tests noTimeStamps.  Also generates a job report file
	(u1_job_report.mxml).   
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u2	Tests handling of a message generated pre-configuration, by using the
	special generate_preconfiguration_message parameter in the cfg file.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u3	Generates a plain-vanilla statistics destination (not matching any 
	output destination).
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u4	Generates a pair of statistics destinations but assigns a different 
	file name for one of them (other than the pset name) anda threshold for
	the other.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	
u5	Tests reset versus no reset behavior when multiple statistics 
	summaries are triggered.  (That is, if untracked bool reset = true 
	then the next time statistics are triggered, they start from having
	been cleared the last time the sumary was sent out.)
	---------- UnitTestClient_B

u9	Tests behavior when using the official MessageLogger.cfi.
	---------- UnitTestClient_G

u10	Use of  extensionless filenames
	---------- UnitTestClient_C

u11	reportEvery, and some overall defaults
	overall defaults regarding reportEvery
	overall defaults for all destinations, for unnamed categories 
	overall defaults for all destinations, specific category     
	default reportEvery for a destination superceding overall default                    
	default reportEvery for a destination not superceding 
		specific category overall default 
	reportEvery for specific category superceding both defaults                            
	reportEvery and limits interacting with each other
	---------- UnitTestClient_F
	
u12	Tests the placeholder feature. 
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u13	Tests LogVerbatim and LogTrace
	---------- UnitTestClient_H

u14	Message suppression by severity and by module.  For example,
	suppressInfo = { "sendSomeMessages", "source" }
	Does not test suppressInfo = "*" or any excludeModule or such.
	---------- UnitTestClient_I

u15	LogVerbatim and LogTrace; also whether isInfoEnalbled() works
	when it is enabled.  
	---------- UnitTestClient_H
	
u16	Explicit specification of filenames and of extensions in destinations,
	statistics, and jobReports.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	
u17	Threshold levels for destinations, limit=0 for a category,
	enabling all (*) LogDebug, with one destination responding.
	Also verify that by default, the threshold for a destination is INFO,
	and verify name used for "severe" errors is System, not Severe, in 
	summary statistics, and jobReports.
	---------- UnitTestClient_K
	
u18	LogSystem, LogAbsolute, LogProblem, LogPrint, and LogVerbatim.
	---------- UnitTestClient_M
	
u19	Long header lines, to test the non-breaking behavior.
	---------- UnitTestClient_N
	
u20	Test default configuration file for MessageLogger service
	for users that include MessageLogger.cfi and nothing else.
	Side-tests the behavior of isMessageProcessingSetUp() when
	it should be returning true.
	---------- UnitTestClient_G

u21	By-severity default limit on each type of message,
	and specific-category override of that default.
	---------- UnitTestClient_O
	
u22	Tests effect of LogFlush by cfg-configurable choices of how many 
	messages to use to clog the queue and whether or not FlushMessageLog
	is invoked.  Under normal testing, it will invoke FlushMessageLog in
	a situation where its absence would result in different output.
	---------- UnitTestClient_P

u23	Tests effect of GroupLogStatistics(category) 
	by having 6 differently labeled modules (of two distinct classes)
	all of which issue LogIssue with two "grouped" categories.
	---------- UnitTestClient_Q

u24	Behavior when duplicate file names are supplied.  We create two
	destinations, with ERROR and WARNING thresholds, and force the
	files both to be u24.log.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A
	
u25	Imposition of limits and thresholds of specific interest to user
	requests:  Limits per-category on ERROR and WARNING messages.
	---------- UnitTestClient_R
	

u27	Tests proper output of both ungrouped and grouped categories
	in summary placed in the FrameworkJobReport.xml. 
	---------- UnitTestClient_Q

u28	Tests distinct threshold level for linked statistics destination:
	A destination with different PSet name uses output= to share the
	same stream as an ordinary output destination.  But their thresholds
	are different.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A


Non-regression-suite tests (not run via scramv1 b runtests):

u26	Is a near-identical clone of u17, using a different client, and is 
	not in the Buildfile
	---------- UnitTestClient_A

u28_cerr  Tests distinct threshold level for linked statistics destination:
	  A destination with different PSet name uses output=cerr to share the
	  same stream as an ordinary output destination to cerr.  But their 
	  thresholds are different.
	---------- UnitTestClient_A


timing_t   Tests output of Timing service to JobReport
	   (Inherently tough for regression testing as
	   times will change and cannt be suppressed.)
	   ** Run via cmsRun -e timing_t.cfg **
	   Look for and look at FrameworkJobReport.xml
	   and timing_t.log.
	--------- UnitTestClient_A

o1	JobReport output of Memory service
