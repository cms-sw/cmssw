This file defines functions used to check if ROOT dictionaries
are missing for those types that require dictionaries.
Also there is a utility function named public_base_classes that
is used to find the base classes of classes used as elements in
container products. These base classes are needed to setup the
product lookup tables to support Views. That function also checks
for dictionaries of that contained class and its base classes as
it finds them.

As of this writing, the dictionary checking functions are used
in the following circumstances:

1. All produced products.

2. All products in the main ProductRegistry and that are present
in the input.

3. All consumed product types. Also for consumed element types (used by
View). But for consumed element types there is only a requirement that
the element type and its base classes have dictionaries (because there
is no way to know if the containing product type is transient or not).

4. Products declared as kept by an output module.

Transient classes are an exception to the above requirements. For
transients classes the only classes that are required to have dictionaries
are the top level type and its wrapped type. Also if it is a container
that can be accessed by Views, then its contained type and the base classes
of that contained type must also have dictionaries.  But only that.
Other contituents types of a transient type are not required to have
dictionaries. This special treatment of transients is genuinely needed
because there are multiple transient types in CMSSW which do not have
dictionaries for many of their constituent types.

For persistent types it checks the unwrapped type, the wrapped type, and
all the constituent types. It uses the TClass::GetMissingDictionaries
function from ROOT to check constituent types and depends on that.
(Currently, there is a JIRA ticket submitted related to bugs in that
ROOT function, JIRA-8208. We are trying to use the ROOT function for
that instead of creating our own CMS specific code that we need to
develop and maintain.). For transient types, TClass::GetMissingDictionaries
is not used because it requires too many of the constituent types
to have dictionaries.
