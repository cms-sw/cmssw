# timingFilteredMLexample -- 
#                  an example Configuration file for MessageLogger service:

# Illustrates how to limit the output of a category of message to one
# destination but not to another.
#
# This example sets up logging to a file and to cout, and establishes the
# timing service.  The idea is to deliver all messages created by LogWarning 
# and above to cout (as would happen in usual production jobs) EXCEPT to
# suppress the timing messages for cout (but not for the other log file).
#
# This sort of setup was requested by Florian Beaudette, Jean-Roch, Peter Elmer
# and for a time was rendered impossible because the timing service had used
# LogAbsolute for its output; that has since been modified.
#
# cmsRun timingFilteredMLexample_cfg.py outputs to cout, and also produces 
# timingFilteredMLexample.log.  The output to cout should not contain per-event
# timing information.
