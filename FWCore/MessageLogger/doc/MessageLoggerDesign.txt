			MessageLogger Design
			--------------------
Glossary
--------

KitchenSink		Initializes certain static-lifetime entities
			which need to be around before any subtantive
			code in main() is done.  Instantiated at the
			begining of main(); goes out of scope only when
			main() terminates.  We rely on precisely one
			KitchenSink to be instantiated.

MessageLoggerSpigot	Owns the messageLoggerScribe thread -- it starts it,
			it makes it (tells it to) go away.  Concpetually
			a destructible singleton:  We rely on the fact that
			the dtor is invoked at the end of the job, to
			cleanly terminate the messageLoggerScribe thread.
			Instantiated early in instantiation of a KitchenSink.
			We do not use the DestructibleSingleton pattern
			because we want to keep the code reuired in
			KitchenSink as trivial as possible.

MessageLoggerQ		Interthread communication buffer of MessageLoggerSlot
			blocks.  Handles all the locking, blocking, sleeping,
			waking, etc.  Singleton.  Makes use of framework's
			Interthread communication buffer mechanism.

MessageLoggerScribe	Singleton, responsible for creating, owning, and
			managing the (single) ErrorLog and for consuming
			MessageLoggerSlot blocks from the MessageLoggerQ.

MessageSender		Primary interface between the user composing a
			message (by invoking LogWarning or the like) and
			the MessageLoggerQ, for which it acts as a producer.

MessageLogger		A framework service, which when started up (and
			possibly at other times) passes	parameter-set
			or other information via the  MessageLoggerQ
			for purpose of configuring the behavior of the
			ErrorLog owned by MessageLoggerScribe.

MessageSender LogWarning (const char* id)
{
  return MessageSender (ELwarning, id);
}

1) a pre-services activity issues a LogError("id"):

  a) Because the first thing main does ins instantiate a KitchenSink,
     and the first thing the ctor of KitchenSink does is instnatiate
     a (default) MessageLoggerSpigot, the ctor of MessageLoggerSpigot
     has already been called.

  b) The ctor of MessageLoggerSpigot starts a thread, running
     messageLoggerScribe, which instantiates a MessageLoggerScribe
     and calls its activate() method.  So this will already have been done.

  c) The ctor of MessageLoggerScribe has already attached an ELoutput (using
     cerr) to the error logger.  So the errorLogger does have one sensible
     destination.

  d) The activate() member function is in a loop, getting a buffer from
     the queue, which is found by invokiing messageLoggerQ(). messageLoggerQ()
     has a function-level static MessageLoggerQ, so even if this was not
     in place before, that queue certainly exists by the time activate()
     tries to get a buffer.

  d*)If the queue is empty, activate() sleeps at that point.  Eventually
     somebody -- in fact, somebody we will encounter next in this story-line,
     will obtain a buffer from the queue, fill it, and commit.  That will
     cause the buffer() method to wake up, in possesion of a committed buffer.

  e) One of the pre-services activities decides, for some reason, to issue
     a message via (say) LogWarning.  The syntax of the statement issuing
     the message is
     LogWarning("myid") << a << b;

  f) LogWarning is a free function, returning a MessageSender which it
     constructs.  The MessageSender class contains an ErrorObj*, which
     the ctor initializes to point to an ErrorObj on the heap, constructed
     from ELwarning and myid.  This ErrorObj, though allocated via new,
     will not be deleted explicitly by MessageSender - instead, an auto_ptr
     will be formed to pass that duty onward.

  g) The messageSender now has a couple of invocations of operator<<().  It
     passes a and b on to its internal ErrorObj in the obvious manner.

  h) At the end of the statement issuing the message, the MessageSender
     returned by LogWarning goes out of scope and is destructed.

  i) The dtor of MessageSender obtains a slot in the queue obtained by
     messageLoggerQ().  It casts this unstructured slot into form for taking
     a command and an auto_ptr to an ErrorObj.  It then fills that structure
     with the command LOG and an auto_ptr to the on-the-heap ErrorObj
     (at this point, it is relieved of responsibility for deleting the
     ErrorObj).

  j) The last act of the MessageSender dtor is to call the commit() member
     function of the slot obtained.  Now we resolve the hanging execution
     issue that we left at steps d and d*:  activate() has obtained a buffer.

  k) The unstructured buffer is cast into a raw MessageLoggerSlot, and the
     command member of that struct is examined and found (in this case) to
     be LOG.

  l) An auto_ptr<ErrorObj> is formed from the pointer sitting in the
     raw slot.  This is done by casting the raw memory into its Message
     SenderSlot form.  This is crucial because we had "lost" the auto_ptr
     nature of that pointer.

  m) The activate() is a member function of MessageLoggerScribe; it has
     the class variable errlogp in scope.  *ep is sent (<<) to that
     error logger.  Thus the message is formated and comes out in all
     the destinations -- in this case just cerr -- attached to the logger.

  n) At the end of the LOG case, the auto_ptr goes out of scope, thus deleting
     the ErrorObj so that the memory on the heap is properly freed.

  o) At the end of the switch on command, the buffer is replaced into the pool.
     Since dontDie remains true, the loop continues -- and the
     messageLoggerScribe thread immediately sleeps since now the queue is empty.
     It is waiting for a new message or other command.

2) a post-services activity issues a LogError("id"):



3) end of job is reached (MessageLoggerSpigot is destructed):
