/**\class edm::JobReport

Description: A service that collections job handling information.

Usage:
The JobReport service collects 'job handling' information (currently
file handling) from several sources, collates the information, and
at appropriate intervals, reports the information to the job report,
through the MessageLogger.

CMS-THREADING Some notes about thread safety:

1. It is assumed non-experts will turn the job report on
and look at the XML output and NOT call the available public
functions. Many of the available service functions can be
called at times that are not thread safe (causing data
races or interleaved output). The following notes are for
Framework experts and detail the assumptions made when
modifying JobReport to run in the multithreaded Framework.

2. We assume the primary input source performs its activity
serially. There can be multiple secondary input sources running
concurrently.

3. We assume the following sequence of activities where the lines
of asterisks indicate synchronization points:

****************
open primary input file
nothing else running concurrently
Also respondToOpenInputFiles serially
****************
open output files serially
nothing else running concurrently
****************
The primary source runs its other tasks concurrently
with the secondary sources running their tasks and
modules running their tasks.
****************
close primary input file
nothing else running concurrently
****************
close output files serially
nothing else running concurrently
****************
repeat the above (the output file opens and closes
are optional except for the first and last)
***********************
All endJob and postEndJob activities occur serially
not concurrently
************************

4. We assume that a single instance of an OutputModule
will only be running on one thread at a time.
Other instances of that type of OutputModule may be running
concurrently. There are several functions where this is
an issue. We have discussed that in the future we might
decide to run the OutputModule for multiple events
concurrently. That would require further modifications
of either the JobReport or the OutputModule.

5. For Primary and SecondaryFile input sources (not
SecondarySource) the calls to reportBranchName from the
delayed reader need to be serialized.
