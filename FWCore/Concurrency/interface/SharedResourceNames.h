  // Each time the following function is called, it returns a different
  // name.  The purpose is to address the following problem.
  // A few classes that are modules sometimes use shared resources
  // and sometimes do not use shared resources. It depends on their
  // configuration and also on their template parameters. These classes
  // have to always inherit from the SharedResources base class. If
  // they do not declare any share resources the Framework assumes
  // they depend on all possible shared resources. This causes performance
  // problems. In the cases where they really do not use any shared
  // resources, one has to declare something to avoid the default
  // assumption that they depend on everything. If a nonexistent
  // shared resource is declared and as long as nothing else declares
  // the same shared resource name, there will be no performance effects.
  // This function provides a unique name to be used for that purpose.
