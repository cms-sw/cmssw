# This was written to benchmark some changes to
# the getByLabel function and supporting code. It makes
# a lot of getByLabel calls although it is not particularly
# realistic in the product list it uses ...
# Not intended for use as unit test because it does not
# test anything not tested elsewhere. Only useful for
# simple benchmark tests.
