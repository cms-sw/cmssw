# This file contains Effective Area constants for 
# computing pile-up corrections for the photons isolation
# for a photon object.
#    
#  The constants are based on 90% contours of isolation.
# These effective areas are also found on the following slides:

# IMPORTANT: this file with effective area constants was created after a bug was
# discovered in the photon MVA implementation of Spring 16. The bug was in using abs(eta)
# outside of std namespace, which means that abs was returning an int, truncating the
# eta values. To fix the bug but preserve the behavior of the ID that has been in use
# for a while at that point, the effectively used effective area was created that
# has 3 meaningful bins instead of the original 6 bins (and the bug is fixed).
#   The photon MVA uses only the pf photon isolation, and doesn't use the other types,
# so only this file was necessary to create.
