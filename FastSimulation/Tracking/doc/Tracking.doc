\section desc Description
<!-- Short description of what this package is supposed to provide -->

The package deals with the interface between the Fast Simulation and the reco::Tracking package in the Full Reconstruction.<br>
In FastSim a fast tracking is implemented, in which only the RecHits produced by a given simTrack are fitted, so that the time-expensive pattern recognition step can be avoided. <br>
For the track fit, however, the same Iterative Tracking procedure as in the Full Reconstruction is implemented: the configurations in the /python directory are used to steed the customized Iterative Tracking for FastSim.
