# This cfg configures the part of reconstruction 
# in FastSim to be done after event mixing
# FastSim mixes tracker information on reconstruction level,
# so tracks are recontructed before mixing.
# At present, only the generalTrack collection, produced with iterative tracking is mixed.

#All work is now done with the fastSim era
