Sample: particles
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample uses CUDA to simulate and visualize a large set of particles and their physical interaction.  Adding "-particles=<N>" to the command line will allow users to set # of particles for simulation.  This example implements a uniform grid data structure using either atomic operations or a fast radix sort from the Thrust library
