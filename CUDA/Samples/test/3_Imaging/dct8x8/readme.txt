Sample: dct8x8
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample demonstrates how Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for blocks of 8 by 8 pixels can be performed using CUDA: a naive implementation by definition and a more traditional approach used in many libraries. As opposed to implementing DCT in a fragment shader, CUDA allows for an easier and more efficient implementation.
