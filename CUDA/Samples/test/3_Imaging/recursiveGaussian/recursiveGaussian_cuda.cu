    Recursive Gaussian filter
    sgreen 8/1/08

    This code sample implements a Gaussian blur using Deriche's recursive method:
    http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/deriche93recursively.html

    This is similar to the box filter sample in the SDK, but it uses the previous
    outputs of the filter as well as the previous inputs. This is also known as an
    IIR (infinite impulse response) filter, since its response to an input impulse
    can last forever.

    The main advantage of this method is that the execution time is independent of
    the filter width.

    The GPU processes columns of the image in parallel. To avoid uncoalesced reads
    for the row pass we transpose the image and then transpose it back again
    afterwards.

    The implementation is based on code from the CImg library:
    http://cimg.sourceforge.net/
    Thanks to David Tschumperlï¿½ and all the CImg contributors!
