Sample: bilateralFilter
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

Bilateral filter is an edge-preserving non-linear smoothing filter that is implemented with CUDA with OpenGL rendering. It can be used in image recovery and denoising. Each pixel is weight by considering both the spatial distance and color distance between its neighbors. Reference:"C. Tomasi, R. Manduchi, Bilateral Filtering for Gray and Color Images, proceeding of the ICCV, 1998, http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~manduchi/Papers/ICCV98.pdf"
