Sample: simpleSeparateCompilation
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample demonstrates a CUDA 5.0 feature, the ability to create a GPU device static library and use it within another CUDA kernel.  This example demonstrates how to pass in a GPU device function (from the GPU device static library) as a function pointer to be called.  This sample requires devices with compute capability 2.0 or higher.
