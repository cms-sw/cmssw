Sample: simpleP2P
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This application demonstrates CUDA APIs that support Peer-To-Peer (P2P) copies, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) addressing, and Unified Virtual Memory Addressing (UVA) between multiple GPUs. In general, P2P is supported between two same GPUs with some exceptions, such as some Tesla and Quadro GPUs.

Performance Strategies
Asynchronous Data Transfers
Unified Virtual Address Space
Peer to Peer Data Transfers
