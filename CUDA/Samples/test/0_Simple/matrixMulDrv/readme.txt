Sample: matrixMulDrv
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample implements matrix multiplication and uses the new CUDA 4.0 kernel launch Driver API. It has been written for clarity of exposition to illustrate various CUDA programming principles, not with the goal of providing the most performant generic kernel for matrix multiplication. CUBLAS provides high-performance matrix multiplication.

Key concepts:
CUDA Driver API
Matrix Multiply
