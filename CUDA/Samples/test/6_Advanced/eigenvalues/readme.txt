Sample: eigenvalues
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

The computation of all or a subset of all eigenvalues is an important problem in Linear Algebra, statistics, physics, and many other fields. This sample demonstrates a parallel implementation of a bisection algorithm for the computation of all eigenvalues of a tridiagonal symmetric matrix of arbitrary size with CUDA.
