Sample: ptxjit
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample uses the Driver API to just-in-time compile (JIT) a Kernel from PTX code. Additionally, this sample demonstrates the seamless interoperability capability of the CUDA Runtime and CUDA Driver API calls.  For CUDA 5.5, this sample shows how to use cuLink* functions to link PTX assembly using the CUDA driver at runtime.
