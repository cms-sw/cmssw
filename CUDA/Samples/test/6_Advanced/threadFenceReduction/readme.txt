Sample: threadFenceReduction
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

This sample shows how to perform a reduction operation on an array of values using the thread Fence intrinsic to produce a single value in a single kernel (as opposed to two or more kernel calls as shown in the "reduction" CUDA Sample).  Single-pass reduction requires global atomic instructions (Compute Capability 2.0 or later) and the _threadfence() intrinsic (CUDA 2.2 or later).
