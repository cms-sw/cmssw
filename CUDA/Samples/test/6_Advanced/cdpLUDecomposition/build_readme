The build process results in the following warning: 

nvlink warning : Stack size for entry function '_Z15dgetrf_cdpentryP12Parameters_s' cannot be statically determined

There is some use of recursion inside the program. As a result this warning cannot be avoided because the compiler cannot determine stack size in instances of recursion.
