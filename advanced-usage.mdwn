### How do I checkout the full CMSSW repository locally?

To checkout the full CMSSW repository locally you can do:

    git clone cmssw-main src

in your SCRAM work area.  Notice this will require a github account (see
[here]() for the relevant FAQ). Alternatively you can do:
    
    git clone cmssw-main-ro src

for read only access. If you want to checkout a given tag, you need to 
specify it via the `-b` flag, e.g.:

    git clone cmssw-main src -b CMSSW_6_1_0

See [here][git-clone-repo] for more detailed information on `git clone`
command.

[git-clone-repo]: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository

### How do I browse / search the code?

The source code for the official CMSSW repository can be found in the main
github page for CMSSW: <https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw>.

Branches and tags are available by clicking on the "branches" combo box in the
top left part of the page:

![branches-dialog](images/branches-dialog.png)

The source-code of the official CMSSW can be searched by using
<https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/search>.

If you prefer using the command line interface, you can do the same by using
`git grep` command inside `CMSSW/src` area:

    git grep <reg-expr>

e.g.:

    git grep Plugin.*

which will give you:

    Alignment/CSA06AlignmentAlgorithm/BuildFile:<use name=FWCore/PluginManager>
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentAlgorithm/BuildFile.xml:<use   name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentAlgorithm/interface/AlignmentAlgorithmPluginFactory.h:#include "FWCore/PluginManager/interface/PluginFactory.h"
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentAlgorithm/interface/IntegratedCalibrationPluginFactory.h:#include "FWCore/PluginManager/interface/PluginFactory.h"
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/BuildFile.xml:<use   name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/interface/AlignmentMonitorPluginFactory.h:#include "FWCore/PluginManager/interface/PluginFactory.h"
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/plugins/AlignmentMonitorTemplate.cc:// #include "PluginManager/ModuleDef.h"
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/plugins/AlignmentStats.cc:#include "FWCore/PluginManager/interface/ModuleDef.h"
    Alignment/CommonAlignmentMonitor/plugins/BuildFile.xml:<use   name="FWCore/PluginManager"/>
    ...

for more information about `git grep` click [here](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep).

### How do I tell who is responsible for a given change?

Let's say you want to find out who is responsible for a given
change in `FWCore/Framework/BuildFile.xml`. If you are happy with using
the web based GUI you can simply browse to the given file ([click
here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/FWCore/Framework/BuildFile.xml)
for this particular example). 

Then click on the "Blame" button (again [click
here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blame/master/FWCore/Framework/BuildFile.xml)
for the particular example). 

![blame button](images/blame-button.png)

You can get the full information about a given change
(including which files changed in the same commit) by clicking on the 
specific commit-id (the hash in the left column, [for example
bd2fd326](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/bd2fd32657121cda0cc132a98b3b0d68773788b8)).

Alternatively if you prefer doing it from the command line, you can use the
`git blame` command to find out for each line which `commit-id` is responsible
for a given change.

    > git blame FWCore/Framework/BuildFile.xml

which returns:

    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000  1) <use   name="DataFormats/Common"/>

    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000 11) <use   name="boost"/>
    bd2fd326 (wmtan 2013-01-30 23:21:16 +0000 12) <use   name="rootcintex"/>
    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000 13) <use   name="rootcore"/>
    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000 14) <export>
    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000 15)   <lib   name="1"/>
    f4330d28 (wmtan 2010-02-18 23:10:32 +0000 16) </export>

Let's say we are interested in line 12, i.e. `<use   name="rootcintex"/>`. 
The first column gives us the `commit-id` (`bd2fd326` in this case). To find out everything
about that commit you can use the `git show` command:

    git show bd2fd326

which returns:

    commit bd2fd32657121cda0cc132a98b3b0d68773788b8
    Author: wmtan <>
    Date:   Wed Jan 30 23:21:16 2013 +0000

### Downloading from github is painfully slow, how can I improve the situation?

If you have a local mirror of CMSSW repository at your site / university you
can use it by setting the `CMSSW_MIRROR` environment variable. E.g.:

    export CMSSW_MIRROR=https://:@git.cern.ch/kerberos/CMSSW.git
    # setenv CMSSW_MIRROR https://:@git.cern.ch/kerberos/CMSSW.git

for CERN.

`git addpkg` will then use it to fetch most of the data, and then switch to the
official repository for fetching the missing parts.

If you happen to have a local copy of the reposiry on the machine you are working
on you can speed up things even further by having:

    export CMSSW_GIT_REFERENCE=<repository-path>

in particular people working on lxplus can use:

    export CMSSW_GIT_REFERENCE=/afs/cern.ch/cms/git-cmssw-mirror/cmssw.git

### How do I setup a local mirror?

Git allows you to mirror a repository by doing:

    CMSSW_MIRROR_PATH=<some-path>
    git clone --mirror --bare https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw.git $CMSSW_MIRROR_PATH

Done that you can update the mirror via:
    
    cd $CMSSW_MIRROR_PATH
    git remote update

### How do I collapse multiple commits into one?

A very common pattern when developing a feature with git is to commit very
often, to keep track of even small set of changes and once one is happy with
the feature branch to go back, collapse all the minor changes and write a nice
commit message.


Let's assume for example you have a very long commit history for a topic branch
`my-topic`.

    * 00b32e7 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:07:19 +0200 (10 minutes ago) (HEAD, my-topic)
    |           A typo.  Giulio Eulisse
    * 6ed6e45 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:06:49 +0200 (11 minutes ago)
    |           Some documentation added.  Giulio Eulisse
    * 74f8fd0 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:06:34 +0200 (11 minutes ago)
    |           Some more bug fixes.  Giulio Eulisse
    * 39165d9 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:06:00 +0200 (12 minutes ago)
    |           Some bugfix.  Giulio Eulisse
    * 3a775f1 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:05:21 +0200 (12 minutes ago)
                Initial commit for topic.  Giulio Eulisse

once you are completely happy with your topic branch, you might not
particularly care about all the intermediate steps, and you might want to
squash all of them into one. This is done by using the `git reset` command: it
will rever you back to a given commit, but it will keep your changes in the
working tree, ready to be committed. E.g.:

    git reset --soft 3a775f1

will reset the commit index to the "Initial commit for topic." but it will
leave all code changes ready to be committed. You can then amend the initial commit
with all the changes you previously did by simply doing:

    git commit --amend

which will prompt for an updated message and will results in one single commit:

    * f7400d3 - Sat, 6 Apr 2013 11:05:21 +0200 (19 minutes ago) (HEAD, master)
                Some Feature added and tested.  Giulio Eulisse

For more information about how to rewrite history, you can have a look at the
[git guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History). In
particular once you are familiar with the concept you might want to look at
[`git rebase
--interactive`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) which provides
more flexibility when you want to do more that simply merge a set of commits
into one.
