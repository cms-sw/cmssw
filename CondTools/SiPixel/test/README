 Some data files are found in the external area, see CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH for its location.
 The files are visible in the search path (CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH) assuming
 all the files are accessed with FileInPath, instead of direct filesystem calls.

 These files can be found under the same path, as they would be under the usual software area.

 Examples:

   CalibTracker/SiPixelESProducers/data     is the location of template and generror data
